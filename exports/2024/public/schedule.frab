&#13;
The much loved, saviour of early mornings, the Tea Tent is set to return for 2024!&#13;
&#13;
Whether its 7 am, or late at night, there will likely be hot water ready for you! (Times are approximate, it'll likely be 24/7...)&#13;
&#13;
Intended as a social hub, please do pop along, have some tea, talk to people, whatever! The Tea Tent is for you!&#13;
&#13;
Coffee drinkers tolerated with sufficient medical note, or diplomatic message ;)&#13;

It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one German Apfelweine,&#13;
&#13;
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs &#13;

&#13;
We'll try to be outside, weather permitting. If we meet by the entrance to the Lounge - we'll find some outside space.&#13;
&#13;
Thankfully crime in a public space is rare. But it&#8217;s common for an adult or child to be worried, anxious or even frightened when walking around on their own, or engaging socially outside their home, especially during winter evenings. For some, these feelings have been compounded by isolation during lockdown. Although difficult situations seldom arise, the unexpected can happen.&#13;
&#13;
I offer an interactive workshop, designed for adults and children -  over 10 years old who are beginning to experience greater independence from their parents or guardians. This newfound freedom comes with some risk, which can be substantially reduced using some straightforward preparation and techniques.&#13;
&#13;
My workshop empowers and encourages adults and children to take responsibility for their own safety, giving them confidence.&#13;
&#13;
As a father of three I know the incredible confidence kids experience when they feel able to navigate our world - and the reassurance that can give to parents and carers. I&#8217;d love to pass my knowledge and advice to you and your children.&#13;
&#13;
I focus on spatial awareness, avoiding uncomfortable situations and confrontation, simple planning, safe conduct whilst on the street, and what to do in an emergency situation. Key areas covered:&#13;
&#13;
- Preparing yourself: planning/clothing/valuables/bags&#13;
&#13;
- On the move: street awareness/danger areas/safe areas/what to do in an emergency&#13;
&#13;
- Mobile phone security: IMEI/contacts/emergency calls&#13;
&#13;
- Travelling on a bus/train: planning journeys/safety at bus stop/station and on bus/train&#13;
&#13;
I have current DBS clearance, Safe Guarding Level 1 and First Aid qualifications. Get in touch with Leo for more info at emf.wilkin.xyz&#13;

We have a studio in London where we do pen plotting, tinkering, crafting, and making with robots and machines. You&#8217;re welcome to join me at our van (what3words: smoker.evolution.coolest) for interactive ad-hoc crafting sessions and a friendly chat on all things crafting, cutting, vinyl, heat pressing, or even pen plotters if you&#8217;re interested.&#13;
&#13;
I&#8217;m happy to let you get involved in designing and pressing, or watch and learn. &#13;
&#13;
I will have a variety of supplies on hand, including types of vinyl, heat transfer, infusible ink, and adhesive vinyl. I can discuss the differences between all of these and the sorts of projects you might consider each one for.&#13;
&#13;
We intend on hosting you at our camper van, wherever we&#8217;re parked, but if you&#8217;re interested or have questions, you&#8217;re welcome to fill in this form and I can keep you posted on where we&#8217;ll be:&#13;
&#13;
https://forms.gle/qe8rhssk87bFrgMZ7&#13;
&#13;
- I can help customise something you already have for &#163;5 - be it a cotton shirt, a mug, a water bottle, or a tumbler, I will have supplies available to customise something you already have on hand - If you have a blank cotton t-shirt and an SVG design file, we can even look at creating a logo or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (one colour designs only). There is a cost of &#163;5 per item to cover supplies, but it could be a fun way to bring new life into something you already have. Mugs and tumblers will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I have. I have a variety of colours, including foil designs to customise with. Please bring supplies with you for this, I will not have anything extra. For T-shirts, any cotton shirt will do; I usually pick mine up from Tesco or Sainsbury&#8217;s, where they have many options in different colours.&#13;
&#13;
If you&#8217;re interested in designing something new, I will have a small variety of blanks available for customisation and purchase while stocks last.&#13;
- 12 oz coffee mugs (&#163;12) - You can use sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs suitable for cutting out, or I have some infusible ink pens for drawn designs that would work great with these mugs&#13;
- Accessory bags (large: &#163;20; and small: &#163;18): I can customise these bags using Heat Transfer vinyl, which is great for monograms or simple designs. I have access to a design library if you need ideas for what to include with your bag designs. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags with a navy blue base and natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in black, natural, navy, or pink. I have a couple of pre-made options available too.&#13;
- 20 oz skinny tumblers (&#163;30) - Using sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs, these are great for cut-out designs&#13;
- Sublimation t-shirts (&#163;24) (Small&#8212;large sizes; I have some XL, but I think they run small, so please check with me on sizes)&#8212;These are sublimation t-shirt blanks and would work with the infusible ink transfer sheets and infusible ink pens. Also, if you&#8217;re curious why you can do sublimation on some shirts but not on others, come by and chat with me about the different materials.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-739-cutting-machines-vinyl-pressing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2419">Heidi Blanton from Forge &amp; Craft</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="702" guid="f813e50c-f836-5c3e-914d-ddcb621ed2f2"><room>Lounge</room><title>Matchmaking for Creators</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-05-31T16:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/702-matchmaking-for-creators</url><start>16:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Making anything alone is hard, especially nowadays when everything is so complicated. Corporations have cash to 'invest' on churning out the latest money-grubbing doodads, but it's not easy to meet collaborators outside that framework, especially without funding. How can a programmer with an idea find an engineer to develop it with? How can a writer with a script find an illustrator? It's even more difficult if your project prioritizes social and environmental justice over profit. Until... soon, maybe?!&#13;
&#13;
To save humanity from itself, we need inventions and creations that the FTSE 500 will never provide. Let's meet and discuss how we can build a network to connect people with the ideas, skills, knowledge, time and resources which, when pooled, may just change the world for the better.

Our project explores mums&#8217; experiences of baby feeding decisions. The interactive project is inspired by the Welsh quilting tradition, bringing communities together through crafting, whilst digital touch points stitched into the quilt allow mothers stories to be heard. &#13;
If you want you can give us some feedback about the way it make you feel through a survey. &#13;
The stories embedded in the quilt range from positive and uplifting to potentially distressing, including mention of illness, birth complications and feeding problems.

In rural areas, we often lose cellular wireless signal entirely, even within highly technologically advanced economies such as the UK, EU, US etc. We then find that we are unable to send or receive text messages, even emergency messages. &#13;
&#13;
In the 1990s, visionary scientists and engineers developed alternative voice and messaging systems, using satellites as their &#8216;flying&#8217; cell towers. We will discuss an example of such a pioneering network, called Iridium, which has operated successfully from the late 1990s right up to the present day. Today&#8217;s scientist and engineer visionaries are now proposing that the same &#8216;space-based&#8217; capabilities could be added to our everyday smartphones, without needing to purchase a separate satellite-messaging device. This would allow our phone, when necessary, to switch from the land-based TN to the space-based &#8216;Non-Terrestrial Network&#8217; (NTN). In this presentation we will discuss some of the technical challenges in achieving this &#8216;Direct-to-Device&#8217; (D2D) satellite messaging feature, and some of the solutions which are being proposed, and even already being tested for real. One of the leading players in this space is Starlink, so buckle up for a wild ride!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-40-sending-text-messages-through-space</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="793">Damian Bevan</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-40-sending-text-messages-through-space</url></recording></event><event id="265" guid="0456954c-7aa0-5ab9-ae96-3283bd56f847"><room>Stage B</room><title>The Tiny Tool Kit Manifesto</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T11:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/265-the-tiny-tool-kit-manifesto</url><start>11:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>What is the best tiny toolkit for hacking in a field, fixing robots in the wild and repairing products for friends?&#13;

Conditions are often wet, muddy and involve confined spaces. This talk will look at how the technology we have developed has changed how we measure and create maps of cave systems. From traditional sighting compasses, tape measures and paper and pencil, to laser measures, bluetooth data transfer and PDAs or mobile phones as recording and drawing devices. Then once the data is collected underground, how open source software has been developed by cavers to process the data and draw maps which adjust to later changes in positions of parts of the cave when more data is collected or corrected. We'll look at loop closures, explorations of places no person has gone before, and different ways to present a 3 dimensional map of a 70km cave system. There will be plenty of photographs and video clips of cave exploration, along with live software demos and viewing of digital maps.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-256-how-to-map-caves</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1087">Footleg</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-256-how-to-map-caves</url></recording></event><event id="337" guid="e7bfe355-ff7a-5a6e-b422-62b534477354"><room>Stage B</room><title>GPS time, leap seconds, and a clock that's always right</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T13:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/337-gps-time-leap-seconds-and-a-clock-thats-always-right</url><start>13:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>It sounds easy enough: build a clock that always shows the correct local time, no matter where you take it. Mobile phones can sort-of do this, but they manage by listening to the cell towers, so this won't work everywhere. "Radio controlled" clocks just listen to a low frequency broadcast, there's a few different transmissions across the world but they're incompatible and know nothing of time zones. Desktop computers can use the internet for time, but you still have to tell it what zone you're in.&#13;
&#13;
Really, it should be possible to build a clock with nothing more than a GPS receiver, which figures out the time on its own, with no need for internet or cellular connection. It turns out that doing this requires an on-board world atlas, a spherical coordinate point-in-polygon algorithm, and a complete database of offsets and daylight savings rules.&#13;
&#13;
I finally created a clock that automatically corrects itself as you carry it across country and timezone borders. The journey to this point was so ridiculously tedious that it borders on the absurd. In this talk I'll run through some of the highlights, and of course no talk about GPS time would be complete without mentioning leap seconds, which cause problems even when they don't happen.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-337-gps-time-leap-seconds-and-a-clock-thats-always-right</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="749">Tim Jacobs</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-337-gps-time-leap-seconds-and-a-clock-thats-always-right</url></recording></event><event id="13" guid="73182435-728e-5e7a-b7b2-bcb9253ccdf3"><room>Stage B</room><title>Let's Party Like It's 1994 - Re-Imagining How to Find Stuff Online</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T13:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/13-lets-party-like-its-1994</url><start>13:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Internet search results were a toxic hellstew of ads, SEO spam, content farms and misinformation/disinformation even before the arrival of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in 2023.

&#13;
This talk will highlight a few ways to put search back in the service of the searcher rather than a handful of global megacorps. We&#8217;ll time-travel 30 years to the Internet&#8217;s Cambrian Explosion period, before Lycos, AltaVista and BackRub/PageRank, and look how technologies like Really Simple Syndication (RSS) and open source self-hosted meta-search engines like SearXNG can help.

For this project, we wanted to explore more the findings of previous research around the guilt mothers feel when feeding their babies, but in a more creative way. Coming at the project from 3 very different points of expertise, we worked with mums to design and make a touch interactive quilt.&#13;
We asked mothers of young babies to describe their emotions around feeding, a topic often emotional and controversial, and send a voice clip along with a piece of their baby&#8217;s clothing which we stitched together to create a special interactive quilt. The quilt is embedded with electronic touch sensors which activate the clips when the metal buttons of the clothes are touched. By interacting with them you can hear the stories through headphones. All this results in a very intimate and emotional experience that provides a platform for visibility and understanding and we think is a great conversation starter to share stories and create community. &#13;
The talk will include a timeline of how we created a digitally augmented quilt, and a few thoughts if you want to make one too. It will also include some of our own reflections when working on a project that brings up difficult emotions and sensitive topics. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-34-mothers-g-q-uilt</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="782">Sophia Komninou</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-34-mothers-g-q-uilt</url></recording></event><event id="450" guid="103759a0-37c3-58c0-84e2-0fa76bd0f297"><room>Stage B</room><title>How Roadies became Network Engineers </title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T14:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/450-how-roadies-became-network-engineers</url><start>14:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Over the past five decades, the concert &amp; live event industry has undergone a dramatic transformation into a major sector of the economy, with the production playing a pivotal role. Artists and their shows constantly seek the latest lighting &amp; video technology, intricate stage setups, and top-notch audio quality to dazzle fans. Ticket sales are a major revenue stream for Artists, and a high-quality production show, sells tickets.&#13;
&#13;
This high level of production is only possible because of an industry full of talented roadies. Behind every arena or stadium show lies a hundreads of engineers tirelessly setting up, operating, and dismantling these elaborate stage setups, often in a new venue, on a daily basis. Long gone are the days of makeshift equipment cobbled together, roadies now navigate highly sophisticated AV control systems supported by intricate network infrastructures.&#13;
&#13;
A vast array of specialised hardware caters specifically to live events, engineered to be both flexible for on-the-fly adjustments and durable for daily setup and teardown. Reliability is paramount, with equipment expected to perform flawlessly show after show, never missing a beat. &#13;
&#13;
In this talk we are going to take an overview into the world of live event production, shedding light on how roadies consistently deliver stellar performances day in and day out. We'll explore the intricacies of AV networks, offering an insightful overview of the behind-the-scenes magic that brings unforgettable concerts to life.&#13;

&#13;
So how can you be an espresso alchemist, and convert your bitter shots into gold?&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, I'll cover the anatomy of what goes on during coffee extraction, and the problems that can lead to bad flavoured coffee. I'll also give a whirlwind tour of the different coffee machines, equipment, and hacks that are designed to make better espresso - both the high-value gadets and the duds.

This talk will focus on what has been learnt from years of giving young people the chance to take photos from the ISS using affordable commercial hardware. There will be plenty of the amazing images that have been captured so far, along with some examples of unexpected interruptions and the challenges when you can&#8217;t actually see or touch the equipment yourself. &#13;
&#13;
There will also be a chance for the audience to join in with an interactive game based on some of the photos. You'll need an Internet connected device to join in. &#13;
&#13;
Ground replicas of the actual hardware will also be on show and available for inspection. &#13;

An industrial coffee machine with a touchscreen and cocoa toppings? No idea where we would find enough room for it or if it would actually be used, but of course we'd be interested! &#13;
After a few months of collecting (additional) dust and annoying a few members, we started the quest to get this machine back to work and to explore the (questionable) world of industrial coffee vending legacy, from hardware, over electronics to software architecture. &#13;
&#13;
This is a talk about how we repaired the machine, how these machines usually work, a dive into legacy software and electronics setups, and why those coffee vending machines taste like they do.&#13;
Last but not least, we will discuss how we started to reverse engineer the internal system communication and if we would award a hackvalue of over 9000 for this type of machines.&#13;
&#13;
There is also the final question: does it run Doom?&#13;

We are Dreamcat and we are a group of friends who made our first puzzlehunt for EMF 2018 and haven't stopped since. We love the combination of escape room, treasure hunt, video game, and just a dash of immersive theatre. We want to share that enthusiasm with you, talk about our top mistakes from the last 6 years and what we learned, and hopefully inspire you to go make your own puzzlehunts.&#13;
&#13;
Come along to learn:&#13;
- How to co-opt serious IoT tools for frivolous escape room purposes &#13;
- Why Portal is still the best video game ever made&#13;
- How hard, actually, is &#8220;too hard&#8221;&#13;
- Exactly how many paperclips were harmed in the making of this year's experience &#13;
&#13;
No spoilers for this year's puzzlehunt.

Whether you're for it or (more likely) against it, it's well worth knowing what is actually involved in making it happen and where the real risks are.&#13;
&#13;
The presenter recently left a long career in the US oil industry and will give you a view into this world without any spin or agenda and instead give you the opportunity to deepen your understanding of what it's really all about. What is 'unconventional oil'? What does the process to produce it look like on the ground? What equipment is used? What are the real environmental impacts (beyond climate change)? Whether you want to geek out about heavy equipment or to become a more-educated protester, you'll learn something new.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-59-what-the-frack</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="137">John Thurmond</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-59-what-the-frack</url></recording></event><event id="417" guid="4fb9cc85-fdc5-5708-bf2d-9ecf9ca7354c"><room>Stage B</room><title>When a tree falls in the forest.... does it cause a fire?</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T19:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/417-when-a-tree-falls-in-the-forest-does-it-cause-a-fire</url><start>19:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Overstory uses satellite imagery plus machine learning to understand individual trees - at scale.

&#13;
In this workshop, we will prepare a batch of tempeh together, by cooking soybeans and inoculating them with "Rhizopus oligosporus" spores. While the beans are simmering, we will look a bit into the history and craft of tempeh making.&#13;
&#13;
Each participant will then build a tiny wearable incubator (= petri dish on a lanyard), fill it with the prepared tempeh culture, incubate it over the next 48 hours with his or her own body heat, and watch the mycelium grow.&#13;
&#13;
The lanyards will also provide an excellent conversation starter during the festival and help to spread the tempeh love.&#13;
&#13;
"Rhizopus oligosporus" is a very robust culture, which outcompetes any other bacteria and fungi. Provided you are not allergic to soy, making tempeh is as safe as making other fermented foods (like sourdough or yoghurt). &#13;
&#13;
(Shout out to Maud and Antoine from Domingo Club, wo came up with the idea of making tempeh in wearable petri dishes.)&#13;

I've previously worked costuming for theatre and designing/making wedding dresses.

Boulby is one of just a select few facilities in the world suitable for hosting ultra-low background and deep underground science projects. It is a special place for science, 'a quiet place in the Universe', where studies can be carried out almost entirely free of interference from natural background radiation. It also provides access &amp; support for studies of the geologically interesting deep underground environment.&#13;

But something was wrong - SSH was taking up too much CPU time in the background. This accidental observation led to the discovery of an audacious attempt to introduce a backdoor that would allow an attacker access to almost any system in the world running SSH, an attack made up of both technical and social components.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will describe the backdoor itself, the process that went into it being possible to inject in the first place, and how this was exacerbated by a series of entirely reasonable decisions on the part of Linux distributions. It's a story of social engineering, novel obfuscation mechanisms, and a long con over several years. We'll delve into why distributions patch upstream code, why dependency chains are complicated, and how it's even possible for a compression library to break all the SSH security mechanisms that are intended to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the first place.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-409-the-xz-backdoor-what-why-and-how</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="152">Matthew Garrett</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-409-the-xz-backdoor-what-why-and-how</url></recording></event><event id="146" guid="a26a37df-afd1-5316-be19-eb34b4b203e6"><room>Stage A</room><title>How I found a Roman Villa (or temple)</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T17:20:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/146-how-i-found-a-roman-villa-or-temple</url><start>17:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The Roman archaeological record is far from complete; There are hundreds of high status Roman buildings yet to be located in Britain. &#13;

I was volunteering in the ambulance service during COVID when I was given a piece of Roman pottery by a patient.

&#13;
My talk will demonstrate some free Web-based tools that you can use to investigate your local landscape (LiDAR, etc.). It will also show you non-invasive ways to survey and record archaeological sites. Finally, I'll have some Roman artefacts to handle.&#13;

And anyone can learn to make music, sound (and noise!) with computer chips!  All participants will easily learn all of this by making an ArduTouch music synthesizer from an open hardware kit.  This workshop is for everyone -- even total beginners.&#13;
&#13;
ArduTouch is designed for total beginners to learn to solder, as well as to learn Digital Signal Processing for making sound.  It is called ArduTouch because it is based on Arduino, and it has a touch keyboard.  It also has a built-in speaker/amp, so you can play/perform wherever you go.&#13;
&#13;
ArduTouch comes pre-programmed with a way nice 4-voice sawtooth waveform, but can be easily re-programmed with other way different synths, including already available drums, drones, noise, arpegios, and more; or with synths of your own making.&#13;

In this talk, I'll go over the challenges I've faced in building a Hackspace in a rural town and hopefully show how others can avoid the same pitfalls!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-210-small-town-big-ideas</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="708">Matthew Macdonald-Wallace</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-210-small-town-big-ideas</url></recording></event><event id="183" guid="ff217439-581e-5530-80eb-976fea6e1cf9"><room>Stage C</room><title>Whispered Secrets: Building An Open-Source Tool To Live Transcribe &amp; Summarize Conversations</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T12:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/183-whispered-secrets</url><start>12:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Are you secretly a spy and/or passionate about open-source? Maybe you don't trust a cloud-hosted service with your highly classified information, or perhaps you like to build things for yourself. In this light-hearted talk, you will learn how to make a real-time on-device GenAI-powered application that can live transcribe and summarize conversations without internet access, using open-source components.&#13;
&#13;
Our journey begins with an introduction to open-source LLMs and the latest trends in running GenAI tools on your own hardware. We will build up our application step-by-step, first creating a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeline, then an LLM-based conversation summarization layer, presented within a Streamlit frontend, with conversation summaries sent to a lightweight Django API backend for storage.&#13;
&#13;
Here's why this matters:&#13;
1&#65039;&#8419; Cloud-hosted SaaS tools cannot store highly sensitive information.&#13;
2&#65039;&#8419; Good open-source alternatives exist for most GenAI tasks; the more people who use them, the more they will thrive.&#13;
3&#65039;&#8419; Commercial tools will solve for common use cases, but developers can build personalised tools that are highly specialised for their own bespoke needs.&#13;
&#13;
This talk is tailored for Python enthusiasts and requires no ML expertise. By seeing a practical demo come together piece by piece, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to build their own complex Generative AI applications and be pushed to imagine what they could make for themselves using on-device computation in real-world scenarios. Expect plenty of Python code and some fun live demos, with GitHub code provided for attendees to try it at home.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-183-whispered-secrets</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1724">John Sandall</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-183-whispered-secrets</url></recording></event><event id="414" guid="f55a302e-c5e8-59f8-8789-9ff371daf5b6"><room>Stage C</room><title>Fighting Allergies with Pollen Forecasting</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T13:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/414-fighting-allergies-with-pollen-forecasting</url><start>13:30</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>Many people rely on pollen forecasts to know when their allergies are likely to cause trouble.

&#13;
After a chance introduction to an Austrailian biology student in 2022, Chris and Jay have spent the last few years researching the mechanics of hair growth, the structures of Amino Acids and Keratins and the composition of different parts of human hair. They used this research to develop a suite of software tools that use these bio-mechanics as a structure for creating music.&#13;
&#13;
Chris will cover:&#13;
- the biology of hair&#13;
- generative music systems&#13;
- implementation in Max/MSP and Ableton Live&#13;
&#13;
The talk will end with a brand new piece of music created from a single strand of hair. &#13;

Armed with a PA system, rally lights, under glow and 2 car horns it&#8217;s the perfect centre of chaos for protests or your ALDI shop.&#13;
During our presentation, we invite the audience to delve into the fascinating world of motorising random objects and the art of upcycling, along with the myriad challenges we encountered along the way. From designing our own lithium-polymer batteries to countless iterations and rigorous testing, we'll discuss the intricacies of dealing with electromagnetic interference, experimenting with various motor controllers, and even designing our own from scratch. We want people to experience the shenanigans we went through and the fun we had along the way to hopefully get more people into whacky-wheeled&#8230;..wehicles.&#13;
But it's not all talk! We're excited to demonstrate the trolley live, allowing you to experience first-hand the joy and sheer mayhem it brings. Our goal is to inspire you to embark on your own wacky-wheeled adventures, learning from our missteps and benefiting from our advice and tips.&#13;
No Project is ever truly done lastly we want to look into the future: The intended use cases and how we aim to share our knowledge and plans with the wider community. Our commitment to openness and collaboration means that anyone bold enough to motorise anything around them can benefit from our experiences and insights.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-421-remote-controlled-chaos-cart-how-to-motorise-trash</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1989">Hendrik, Gwen and Callum</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-421-remote-controlled-chaos-cart-how-to-motorise-trash</url></recording></event><event id="169" guid="8066bf25-67d9-57e4-b945-d6f23ba1ada6"><room>Stage C</room><title>From Haunted Karaoke to the Humour Feature: an Exploration of Auto-Generated Comedy</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T15:20:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/169-from-haunted-karaoke-to-the-humour-feature</url><start>15:20</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>In a world where large language models like GPT and Gemini are becoming more and more ubiquitous, what does this mean for comedy? If computers getting things obviously wrong is a factor in their comedy value, do the improvements in generative AI take us into an uncanny valley where the outputs are realistic enough to no longer be funny? &#13;
&#13;
Join our presenters as they each argue the case for one side of the battle between generations from large language models, vs. more naive generation approaches. &#13;
&#13;
We&#8217;ll explore what makes comedy funny at all, and then drill deeper into why we find content generated by computers so hilarious - often when it&#8217;s not trying to be! &#13;
&#13;
Throughout the talk we&#8217;ll give some examples of humorous computer generated content from past projects - intentional or otherwise. Learn why you shouldn&#8217;t join us for dinner when the recipes are auto-generated; see how we abuse state-of-the-art AI safety techniques to make LLMs funnier; and join for a group singalong for some live-generated parody karaoke. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-169-from-haunted-karaoke-to-the-humour-feature</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="160">Ben Below and Matthew Wearden </person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-169-from-haunted-karaoke-to-the-humour-feature</url></recording></event><event id="547" guid="ccedf0fc-85e1-5504-8659-c1f5df6f6dd7"><room>Stage C</room><title>Lightning talks (Friday)</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T16:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/547-lightning-talks-friday</url><start>16:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Short 10 minute talks on any topic</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-547-lightning-talks-friday</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2">Thor</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-547-lightning-talks-friday</url></recording></event><event id="320" guid="4c091421-20ab-5066-b5e0-5137ebda5bd7"><room>Stage C</room><title>Downpour &amp; more: how and why to make creative tools</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T16:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/320-downpour-more-how-and-why-to-make-creative-tools</url><start>16:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>I recently released Downpour, an app that anyone can use to make little games on their phone. And before that I made Cheap Bots, Done Quick, a website that anyone could use to make a Twitterbot on their computer. And so unsurprisingly I am a big advocate of making creative tools - I love the feeling of seeing other people make cool stuff, and knowing that I enabled that to happen. In this talk, I'm going to talk about some design principles I've gathered from making these kinds of things, share some stories of people using them in ways I didn't expect, and generally try to persuade you that it's an interesting space that you might want to play in.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-320-downpour-more-how-and-why-to-make-creative-tools</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="328">v buckenham</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-320-downpour-more-how-and-why-to-make-creative-tools</url></recording></event><event id="87" guid="b3ecfa2a-5f57-53ff-8442-ab1aea12c561"><room>Stage C</room><title>CHERI and Arm Morello: mitigating the terrible legacy of memory-safety security issues, in practice at scale</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T17:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/87-cheri-and-arm-morello</url><start>17:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Computing is riddled with security vulnerabilities, many of which arise from memory safety issues.  Conventional hardware architectures and the C/C++ codebase are chronically prone to exploitable errors - a 75-year-old problem at the heart of computing.  &#13;
&#13;
This talk will introduce CHERI, showing how (finally?!) we can do better.  The CHERI research project has developed a new architecture+software approach, using unforgeable hardware capabilities to implement pointers. Morello is an Arm experimental platform for evaluation of CHERI to explore its potential for mass-market adoption, part-funded by the UKRI Digital Security by Design programme, and other groups are developing CHERI-enabled RISC-V processors, including Microsoft, Google, lowRISC, SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, and RISC-V International. &#13;
&#13;
This talk will introduce the problem, and CHERI and Morello, for a broad audience: the hardware extensions, their potential for fine-grained memory safety and software compartmentalisation, the CHERI software stack, and machine-checked mathematical proof that the architecture design provides the intended security. CHERI complements alternative high-level-language approaches, that would need code to be rewritten from scratch, and we'll talk about the often-low cost of porting code to CHERI. &#13;
&#13;
I'll demo how CHERI prevents exploitable memory safety errors on a Morello box,  running Arm CHERI hardware and a complete CHERI software stack.&#13;
&#13;
This is joint work by the CHERI and Morello teams at the University of Cambridge, Arm, SRI International, and the University of Edinburgh. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-87-cheri-and-arm-morello</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="904">Peter Sewell</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-87-cheri-and-arm-morello</url></recording></event><event id="223" guid="00d341e4-444a-56f2-9bd9-03cdea5e1598"><room>Stage C</room><title>Spotting Seals with Sonar (and A.I.)</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T18:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/223-spotting-seals-with-sonar-and-a-i</url><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Tidal energy is one potential source of green energy but the impact of placing large turbines on the seabed is not fully understood. In particular, how are sea mammals coping with such changes in their environment? Do we need to put automatic mitigations in place &#8211; is it even possible? For over a year, we have been annotating more than 60 terabytes of data, finding these rare events of interest. We&#8217;ve looked at whether Artificial Intelligence, combined with sonar, can automatically spot and classify interesting underwater objects. We&#8217;ve tried several approaches, some more successful than others, but there are promising results with movement detection and segmentation. &#13;
&#13;
This talk covers our initial findings - where we went wrong and one promising approach that we are still actively researching. I'll be talking about U-Nets, convolutional neural networks, sonars and the unknown entities that may lurk in the depths!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-223-spotting-seals-with-sonar-and-a-i</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1511">Benjamin Blundell</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-223-spotting-seals-with-sonar-and-a-i</url></recording></event><event id="45" guid="5c920ca3-5204-5082-902a-24eeb26721f1"><room>Stage C</room><title>The Auto Plane Spotter: a robot to point at aeroplanes</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-05-31T18:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/45-the-auto-plane-spotter-a-robot-to-point-at-aeroplanes</url><start>18:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>As a semi-professional plane spotter when I hear or see an aircraft fly over I will sometimes point at it. But I can't always tell if there's an aircraft flying over, and I can't be awake 24/7 so I miss some, which I find unacceptable. &#13;
&#13;
Enter the auto spotter, a robot that is capable of pointing at the nearest aircraft continuously.&#13;
&#13;
The auto spotter uses 1090Mhz ADS-B Out transmissions to work out where the nearest aircraft is relative to its location and works out the bearing and elevation for a pointer. This is the same public data that is used to feed flight information services and can be received by anyone with the right (relatively cheap) equipment; all commercial and many general aviation aircraft around the world use it to transmit their positions, speeds, altitudes and more.&#13;

&#13;
Your bird will come and join the flock. We'll show you how to write your first micro:bit program, how to play with different ways to make cool sounds, and then how to make your bird a social beast, responding to wireless signals from the flock.&#13;
&#13;
We want you to come and teach your bird how to squeak, squawk, sqauck, quack or even beatbox.&#13;
&#13;
You will need to bring a laptop&#13;
We'll provide the micro:bits, batteries, cables and craft materials.&#13;
&#13;
If you have your own micro:bit (V2), bring it along so you can keep your bird at the end of the festival. if you have servo motors, bring them along and you can make a bird that flaps.&#13;
&#13;
You can code in MicroPython or MakeCode (which is like Scratch)&#13;
&#13;
At the end of the activity we will find a nice tree to hang the birds up somewhere people can come and see, hear and admire them.&#13;

&#13;
We'll provide paper templates and all required materials, you cut and tape the rocket together and then decorate it to taste. Once they're all built we'll take the rockets out to the model flying area and launch them from our launch pad.&#13;
&#13;
Assembling the rocket is straightforward and as they're all made from white card and paper there are plenty of options for decoration or modification. We'll have some helpers on hand to provide guidance.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for young children with supervision. The build involves mostly using scissors and tape, one step involves hot glue which requires adult supervision. Feel free to contact us beforehand if you want to check suitability: emf@adamgreig.com.&#13;
&#13;
There is a limit of one rocket per child.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-635-build-and-fly-a-rocket</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="772">Adam Greig</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event></room><room name="Lockpicking Village Tent"><event id="580" guid="1f4176e1-2462-5701-83af-a1267bd211ad"><room>Lockpicking Village Tent</room><title>Lockpicking</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-05-31T11:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/580-lockpicking</url><start>11:00</start><duration>3:00</duration><abstract>This year will see the return of the ever popular lockpicking village!

Well in this workshop we'll take a peak into the world of sensors and how they work and what they are used for. &#13;
&#13;
We'll use the BBC Microbit which is a tiny computer along with Python/Makecode to store what it sees, then using code we'll create graphs that can allow us to understand what the Microbit is seeing.&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop you'll learn:&#13;
- What sensors the BBC Microbit has&#13;
- How to store/log data coming off of the Microbit's sensors&#13;
- How to create graphs and other ways of seeing the information &#13;

That&#8217;s an issue because pollution levels can vary a lot even between adjacent streets so to get the best picture possible we need more sensors! This is where citizen lead projects like Sensor.Community are doing amazing things.&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop you&#8217;ll put together an air quality monitor made from an ESP8266 and a few sensors, load up the firmware and connect it to the sensor.community network so that other people, scientists and policy makers can see where the problems are and hopefully change something. We&#8217;ll discuss options for weather proofing, where to place the sensor and how to hook it into your own smart home setup if you have one. &#13;
&#13;
I will be selling kits at cost which include:&#13;
    - An ESP8266 Dev board with micro USB port&#13;
    - A BME280 Pressure/Temp/Humidity sensor&#13;
    - A 2m micro USB cable&#13;
    - F-F header cables&#13;
    - An SDS011 particulate matter sensor&#13;
    - A USB power supply **is not** included, let's try to prevent some e-waste by reusuing an old one! &#13;
&#13;
I currently have 10 kits including the SDS011 for &#163;40 and an additional 20 with just the BME280 for &#163;15. You will need to bring your own usb power supply or plug it into a laptop and I will leave the weather proofing up to you once you install it at home.&#13;
&#13;
I can accept payment in cash (exact change only please!), contactless or bank transfer. I don't have a physical card reader so can't accept chip and pin payments only contactless. &#13;
&#13;
A special shoutout will go to anyone who:&#13;
- Scrounges together the parts for a sensor purely from things they get at the camp!&#13;
- Get the firmware running on the EMFcamp badge!&#13;
- Makes an airquality themed Hexpansion for the badge!&#13;
- Does something else unexpected with the idea, it's a citizen lead project after all!&#13;

Using the accessible and fun platform PICO-8 we'll work together to learn how to make a simple game, including everything from code to pixel art graphics and chippy sounds. &#13;
&#13;
The workshop holder has lots of experience from the platform and will help and coach participants to get the most of the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
Things we will cover:&#13;
- the basic game loop&#13;
- moving entities &#13;
- animation&#13;
- collision detection&#13;
- making and playing sounds&#13;
&#13;
We'll also look at some existing games that showcase what is possible with the platform.&#13;
&#13;
After the workshop participants will have a base for a game which they easily can keep working on by themselves if they desire.&#13;
&#13;
PICO-8 uses Lua which is an easy programming language to get started with, but given the time limit on the workshop, basic programming knowledge is preferred. &#13;
&#13;

As told by the prophet DJ Bad Boy, we drink a bottle of Bucky and get out wur chicken.&#13;
&#13;
This blessed wine, produced by Benedictine Monks in Devon, bloody England, is carefully, lovingly barrel aged to a smooth, steady 15% alcohol and is imbued in a holy ceremony with a blessed 280mg of caffeine. Safe passage across the Border has been assured by the Buckfast Accord of 1669 for even the bloody English appreciate that to starve Scotland of its key religious artifact will result in an invasive war and oppressive occupation. This is the source of the common phrase "Buckfast gets you fucked fast" - the leading word "Nae" was dropped due to a misunderstanding of intent during the Victorian era, and now the phrase is a common celebration and acknowledgement of the intensity of the Rites.&#13;
&#13;
When consumed in the appropriate manner (directly from the bottle, completed in roughly 1 hour) it will aid you in seeing through time and being particularly of the moment. Often, first time participants of the Drinkers Rites will find upon completion of their experience that they have voluntarily shed themselves of all material possessions. This is to be expected - when you are accelerated to the Blessed Plane of Existence, the whisperings of ancient gods and creatures that exist between dimensions will often assist the realisation that material possessions are temporary, but Tonic Experiences are for life.&#13;
&#13;
A note of caution to all prospective disciples, however - the intensity of your experience may transfer all the joy contained in your soul to be used tomorrow and expend it during the ritual. This transfer often leads to a despondent day, where one reflects only upon the negative aspects of life. Do not fret, to experience the highest of highs we must understand that with which it contrasts. The despair of the day after, coupled with the infamous Jakey Shakes and occasional rejections of all food and liquid are only temporary.&#13;
&#13;
This is part of the journey as set out by The Wine, produced by the most blessed monks of Devonshire. It teaches us that while all shall return to equilibrium, to break from normality for just a moment of time may bring incredible joy.&#13;
&#13;
Why don't you join Scots of all shapes and sizes at the nearest consular outpost on Friday to experience the Friday Nite Rites. It must be noted, the numbers stamped on the base of the bottle are a measure of ritual experience, and acolytes may start you on a high number (indicating low intensity), restricting the blessed Number 1 bottle for only the most revered members of the encampment.&#13;

Laser cut leather pieces that can be hand sewn together. A blend of maths, technical drawing and modern technology to create an easy to sew bag, wallet purse, bag tag, or glasses case. Different levels of challenge are part of this as the laser cut holes offer many different stitching possibilities. &#13;
&#13;
Kits will be provided with a variety of leathers (including eco and recycled leather) Participants will have the option to create personalised kits that can be taken home to complete after the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
2d CAD is all that is needed but the magic is in the use of simple tools; offsets, arrays, rotations and reflections. Some beautiful maths and geometry mixed with some primary school needlework, do you remember doing crosstich in binca....&#13;
&#13;
The laser cutting and etching will be demonstrated with video and a variety of methods to explore at home from using a printer, Circuit or laser cutter will be shown for those who would like to experiment further.&#13;

This skill will let you, in a pinch, easily carry a watermelon home using your scarf as a bag!&#13;
&#13;
This style of wrapping is becoming more popular as an eco-friendly alternative to wrapping paper -- and the cloth becomes part of the gift!&#13;
&#13;
Furoshiki is to fabric what origami is to paper. This workshop will require some dexterity and patience - if you have less dexterity then you will require more patience but we'll get there together!&#13;

&#13;
This presentation is based on 20 years of off-grid living experience and showcases case studies from an off-grid eco-village from 2000 to 2018.  &#13;
&#13;
The talk aims to share some of the knowledge gained and look into the possibilities for future renewable off-grid living opportunities and how new technologies might be used to improve convenience and efficiency.  Topics covered will include the practical basics of harvesting, storing and using renewable energy as efficiently as possible, new ideas and practical examples, micro-hydro, solar, wind-power, batteries, electrics and wiring, efficiency, smart-micro-grids, renewables and more......</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-159-ogre-tech-and-off-grid-living</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="617">Merlin Howse</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-159-ogre-tech-and-off-grid-living</url></recording></event><event id="173" guid="705f0e59-05ff-541c-adf5-e8842e3d28c8"><room>Stage B</room><title>Connecting Arduinos to websites: A sequence of chaotic live demos</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T10:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/173-connecting-arduinos-to-websites</url><start>10:40</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>Controlling websites with an Arduino is like magic. Suddenly little bits of hardware can control all kinds of games and interfaces on screens. And building a UI for your electronics becomes trivial too.&#13;
&#13;
This is a talk for anyone who&#8217;s ever tinkered with hardware or web design, and wants to join the physical to the digital. &#13;
&#13;
During this talk I will explain the basic techniques of keyboard emulation and using the Javascript Web Serial and Web Bluetooth APIs. To make it fun, and introduce some peril, I will demo all of the techniques live: controlling the Google Chrome Dino game by jumping up and down on stage, making a musical instrument from stretchy rubber and allowing audience members to connect to a set of handbells from their phones.&#13;
&#13;
Along the way will be plenty of tips on what to buy and what to avoid, I&#8217;ll demystify some of the complexity around Bluetooth and USB, and share several ideas for how to use this to cause mischief amongst friends, colleagues and enemies.&#13;
&#13;
I have done this before, but only once.

Every day I deal with the records that people chose to save, or forgot to destroy. Archival material ranges from the sublime (Royal wills, lost love letters, newspapers announcing the Titanic&#8217;s demise) to the ridiculous (broken chips of wax from old seals, IOUs from unknown persons, too much human hair).&#13;
&#13;
A key role of an archivist is to decide what to save and what to destroy. But this is the past. Today most records are no longer on paper but sent in the form of bytes and I&#8217;ve started to wonder what the point of my job really is? We have free access to near-unlimited email inboxes, all our photos are backed up to the cloud to access from anywhere, and instant messaging is synced between our devices. Why bother deciding what to keep for posterity? Just save everything, let computers do the hard work, and all will be well. &#13;
&#13;
This approach unsettled me so much that I set off to explore what it would really mean if we &#8220;saved everything&#8221;: how this would affect our world, communities, and ourselves as humans. In this talk, I will share this journey and my thoughts with you, and try to persuade you that my job is not in fact pointless.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-253-are-archivists-pointless-when-the-cloud-can-just-save</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1828">Erinna Cave</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-253-are-archivists-pointless-when-the-cloud-can-just-save</url></recording></event><event id="69" guid="abc0f8a9-28fd-5304-84ab-7f6684987c53"><room>Stage B</room><title>London to Brighton, by train and on foot</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T12:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/69-london-to-brighton-by-train-and-on-foot</url><start>12:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>During the pandemic, trains got weird for a while. We weren&#8217;t quite sure whether it was safe to travel collectively, and the impacts of that difficult time continue to shape our railway network to this day. &#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, many of us were exploring our own, hyperlocal neighbourhoods on foot with obsessive levels of depth that we never otherwise would have got around to. (Was I the only one who highlighted every street I walked in a London A-Z to see if I could get complete coverage?!)&#13;
&#13;
In 2021, I did a design-based MA all about railways, railway infrastructure, and what it means to travel and live communally. To do this, I walked all the way from London to Brighton (in sections), following the railway line as closely as possible.

And if you didn't, this talk will explain why you should care about a now 40-year-old game.&#13;
&#13;
It was years ahead of its time, with 3D graphics, a procedurally generated open world, and a whole novel's worth of lore - all running on an 8-bit home microcomputer in 1984, when most games were little more advanced than Pac-Man or Space Invaders.&#13;
&#13;
Over the last few years, I've been picking apart the original Elite game engine to understand how it worked, and also to experiment with extending it.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, I'll examine some of the methods that the game used - how it used the graphics hardware, how the game state is represented in memory, how the ship models were designed, how the AI worked, and how galaxies and planets were generated. I'll also explain some quirks of the game... including the real reason that docking was so hard.&#13;
&#13;
I'll demonstrate some new tools I've developed, which access the game state in real time, letting you experience the original game in new ways - including an OpenGL frontend with VR support, and an attempt to recreate an arcade-style version of the game, with an old-school vector display.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, if all goes to plan, I will attempt to demonstrate something that was an impossible dream for 40 years: multiplayer Elite on the original BBC Micro version.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-113-exploring-and-extending-the-elite-game-engine</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1294">Martin Ling</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-113-exploring-and-extending-the-elite-game-engine</url></recording></event><event id="237" guid="2cb90397-ae27-5e21-a042-ed9324f6aa30"><room>Stage B</room><title>Influence policing: a view from the cockpit of UK law enforcement&#8217;s domestic digital influence campaigns</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T13:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/237-influence-policing</url><start>13:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Critical research on digital influence and micro targeting has generally focused on privacy violations by commercial marketers and Cambridge Analytica-style political manipulation. But increasingly, the UK government, police, and security services are using these tools for public policy. The targeted advertising and influence platforms give public sector actors complex tools with which to target behaviour change communications - allowing them to tailor nudge messages based on online behaviour, interests, and fine-detail location. This is allowing the police to use targeted behaviour change advertising to attempt to prevent crime before it happens - but poses serious questions for accountability, ethics, and privacy.&#13;
&#13;
Drawing on a dataset of more than 12,000 government adverts from the Meta Ad Library and in-depth interviews with law enforcement, we map the landscape of what we call 'influence policing' in the UK, and discuss the ethical and democratic implications of this new mode of policing.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-237-influence-policing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1812">Ben Collier</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-237-influence-policing</url></recording></event><event id="377" guid="2c74980d-6045-5385-837d-f98441def4c1"><room>Stage B</room><title>How to move an industry through influence</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T14:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/377-how-to-move-an-industry-through-influence</url><start>14:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Kubernetes has had a rapid ascent to default cloud infrastructure.  However, this didn&#8217;t happen simply because Google open sourced it.  This talk will share the messy human side of the community architecture and how that investment has paid dividends in bringing more under represented minorities into open source leadership.  &#13;
&#13;
I&#8217;ll offer tips and tricks to intentionally manage humans when you have no authority.  you can also expect some of the more complicated situations explosive growth combined with emergent organizing can lead to when governed by those who show up.&#13;

We found a vulnerability on a common office printer that allowed us to run our own code on the device. I'll talk about the whole hacking process, from getting access to the printer software, finding and exploiting a vulnerability, and then how we took that to its logical rollerskating 90s conclusion.&#13;
I'll include some juicy technical bits of course but hope to make this talk accessible and interesting for everyone.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-213-hack-the-printer-hack-the-printer</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="352">Toby</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="43" guid="7649c47c-30ca-54ad-a308-08a3a7663853"><room>Stage B</room><title>Forgotten graphics technology: the wild workings of the direct-view storage tube CRT</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T15:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/43-forgotten-graphics-technology</url><start>15:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>It's 1975! You need a high-resolution computer display for fine drawings (e.g. CAD diagrams). Memory's EXPENSIVE, processors are slow: what to do? Here's an analog solution to a digital problem: an unusual cathode-ray tube that preserves whatever it draws with no flickering, fading, or any kind of refresh. A brilliant dot sears emerald trails into the screen, rendering intricate line-art without pixels. No need for video memory when the screen itself remembers!&#13;
&#13;
It's mesmerising to see this special tube in action; more satisfying still to know how it works. Discover a mechanism Tektronix refined over three decades, growing from palm-sized oscilloscope readouts to 25" computer-lab behemoths. A wreath of electron guns, kilovolt potentials, microscopic cobalt cones, and transparent anodes set the stage for a nonlinear dance of charges that yields visualisations with style --- and we'll unravel its mysteries with animated diagrams. En route we'll visit notable storage tube applications, from early computer memories to 1978's _Battlestar Galactica_. Of course we'll see a real Tektronix terminal at work, too!&#13;
&#13;
Computer memory is cheap now: by the mid 1980s, modern displays had advantages storage-tube systems couldn't overcome. Nobody's making them anymore, so check out this talk while old stock still works!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-43-forgotten-graphics-technology</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="798">Tom Stepleton</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-43-forgotten-graphics-technology</url></recording></event><event id="153" guid="b0146cc5-b34d-5085-9bc3-dd2d03b38129"><room>Stage B</room><title>Security Theatre</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T16:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/153-security-theatre</url><start>16:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>We will take a peek behind the scenes at the technology used in performing arts venues in order to asses the cyber security implications and how we can address them. A modern performing arts space is no longer several independent systems providing show elements such as light and sound, but rather an IP network fabric delivering the desired elements flexibly around the venue and sometimes beyond. As a community we have gathered a good understanding of designing reasonably secure networks and protocols I would like to apply this knowledge to the unique demands of a theatre.&#13;
&#13;
If you often find yourself distracted by the coordination of the light fixtures rather than the performance this talk is for you. Or may you just like designing networks and learning about interesting protocols.&#13;
&#13;
I previously covered Audio over IP in a talk at MCH2022: https://media.ccc.de/v/mch2022-113-audio-networks-and-their-security-implications&#13;
&#13;
In the interest of transparency I am partially employed (and was previously fully employed) by Holoplot a professional audio company that principally sells network based loud speakers. I'm also a freelance security consultant. However, I'm doing this talk purely in a personal capacity and all thoughts an opinions expressed are my own not those of any employers, clients, or customers.&#13;

&#13;
In 2022 and 2023 I mentored a team of 3 teenagers to enter UKROC, the UK youth rocketry challenge. The team had to design and build a rocket to take a raw egg to 250m and return it to the ground in 45 seconds, without breaking the egg. &#13;
&#13;
The team went in 2 years from not knowing much to (spoiler alert) winning UKROC and then the International championship at the Paris Airshow.&#13;
&#13;
I will talk about the basics of model rocketry (physics, engineering, legal, financial, safety etc), what is involved in entering UKROC, our experiences and how you can get involved in the next UKROC competition. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-18-rocket-science-for-teenagers</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="475">Andy Brice</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-18-rocket-science-for-teenagers</url></recording></event><event id="6" guid="3114400f-c0f7-58c9-b562-c96e6b8b88d5"><room>Stage B</room><title>The story of &#196;lgen guitar: how to mix traditional hand-craft woodwork with cutting-edge digital fabrication</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T18:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/6-the-story-of-%C3%A4lgen-guitar</url><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>This talk will take a look at &#196;lgen, a custom-built guitar that is a fusion of traditional hand-crafted woodwork and advanced 3D-printing and generative-design techniques. The guitar is built using no less than 4 different types of 3D-printing, including 3D-printed aluminium. At the same time it sticks with traditional hand built woodwork for the playing surface, matching material with function.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will focus on the design behind the guitar, looking at what you can do with generative design and 3D-printing, how to interface the old and new construction techniques (e.g., mating a walnut body with 3D-printed nylon sides), and how to decide what bits to do with which technique. &#13;
&#13;
I'll also show how I achieved this as an amateur maker: the aim is to show the audience that what seems like far-out construction is actually reachable by us mortals thanks to improvements in tooling and 3D-printing services.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-6-the-story-of-&#228;lgen-guitar</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="361">Michael Dales</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-6-the-story-of-&#228;lgen-guitar</url></recording></event><event id="91" guid="6f93b1ce-722f-5308-8585-13a05b61caa1"><room>Stage B</room><title>Astrophotography on a budget</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T18:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/91-astrophotography-on-a-budget</url><start>18:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>I'll cover what you can do with a limited budget; lenses and cameras you already own (your phone for example); and what you might expect to see.

Satellites, of course! After facing dilemmas of tracking the staff shuttles at a major UK festival, we decided to look at other options and discovered some cheap Iridium satellite constellation hardware on eBay. When they arrived, we surveyed what we had purchased, discovered it was ex-Ministry of Defense hardware, and hasn&#8217;t been scrubbed properly. After getting a new pair of trousers and making the relevant disclosures, we worked to reverse engineer the hardware and get some usable data transmitting into space (and back down).&#13;
&#13;
This involved dumping the firmware of the chip, and stepping bit-by-bit through the memory to understand what was happening, as well as a few casual emails to defence contractors. Getting airtime for satellite hardware was also a challenge, and working around the intricacies of Iridium Short Burst Data. Furthermore, we&#8217;ve developed the concept into an interactive map that overlays the realtime position of the tracker, and gives speed and heading data.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-90-adventures-with-iridium</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="24">Blue and Q</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-90-adventures-with-iridium</url></recording></event><event id="242" guid="1160079a-cb5a-5a43-9cce-db572546a198"><room>Stage A</room><title>How volunteers built and are now operating Hydro Power generation on the Thames</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T10:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/242-how-volunteers-built</url><start>10:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>This is the story of Reading Hydro, how a group of volunteers built and are now operating a hydro generation plant on the Thames in Reading.

+90% of the ones I've seen are badly spec'ed and horribly configured, so they burn way too much gas.&#13;
Then Martin Lewis keeps telling us to "lower the flow temperature" but it's never really explained how to, or what this does to save gas (and money). &#13;
&#13;
Well have I got a Slide Deck for you!!&#13;
&#13;
As with any serious problem, it needs hard data. So I wired my Raspberry Pi home server to my central heating controls, wrote a bunch of code, and spent last winter collecting data from my boiler, a dozen temperature sensors, some humidity sensors and the Octopus Energy API.&#13;
&#13;
I have pretty graphs to show what happens all around my home, how altering the flow temperature works, how altering set points work, why my house was too cold, then too hot, and used way too much gas. &#13;
I'll explain the (simple) physics and how to tweak your system for best performance too. &#13;
&#13;
But ultimately, we all have to stop burning gas and move to heat pumps, a solution not understood by many and requiring something of a mind shift from the way gas central heating has always worked. I'll explain how heat pumps work and what you can do to prepare for their arrival in your home.&#13;
&#13;
The future is bright, and it's heading rapidly in this direction.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-161-gas-boilers-suck-hack-yours-today-save-money-save-the-planet</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="208">Lee V</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-161-gas-boilers-suck-hack-yours-today-save-money-save-the-planet</url></recording></event><event id="80" guid="d7dec1ff-5d76-50ae-ac2b-bad196e0badf"><room>Stage A</room><title>Digital Skeleton Keys - We&#8217;ve got a bone to pick with offline Access Control Systems</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T12:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/80-digital-skeleton-keys-we-ve-got-a-bone-to-pick</url><start>12:00</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>Offline RFID systems rely on data stored within the key to control access and configuration.

&#13;
This is the story of how a strange repeating data pattern turned into a skeleton key that can open an entire range of RFID access control products in seconds.&#13;
&#13;
It&#8217;s a scrappy but scary hack that spawned from something we noticed whilst trying to duplicate an access card onto a subdermal RFID implant. This covers the discovery of the flaw, how we investigated it, and how significant the flaws ended up being.&#13;

I am mechanical engineer with 35+ years&#8217; rail industry experience, working in the fields of vehicle design, analysis, and railway safety &#8211; both in the UK and overseas.&#13;
&#13;
I will endeavour to explain the principles of the individual mechanisms involved, how they work together, and what makes some of them quite unique. I will take time to look at some of the design solutions and approaches used to control dynamic behaviour and some of the risks that are associated.  There may also be an opportunity to look at some of the basics behind the maths along the way. &#13;

&#13;
This is an ongoing project, focusing on offering choice and control in elephants&#8217; environments to investigate preferences around audition and design aesthetics.  Enrichment goals are to provide interesting cognitive and sensory experiences that encourage the expression of natural behaviours.  We&#8217;ll consider the why, what and how associated with all of that animal-computer interaction stuff, and invite people to share their thoughts and suggestions - either remotely or subsequently over a cup of tea.  Love and respect to the elephants in your life.&#13;

The vast majority of our modern foods originate overseas, introduced to Britain by colonialism and Victorian exploration, and the global human diet now contains less than 100 plants, with limited biodiversity.&#13;
&#13;
Starting from the BSBI's database of native and naturalised plants, over the course of 3+ years I painstakingly reseached each entry for historic, archaeological, or ethnographically documented food uses. This body of ancestral knowledge could help provide local food resilience, reduce the impact of the plants we eat, and better protect food supplies from climate change, pollinator loss and disease. &#13;
&#13;
The research is still in its raw form as a giant spreadsheet, so the first part of the talk will focus on the process of research and identification, and some of the trickier questions such as the difference between a food and a medicine, what level of toxicity is tolerable, and how to really define a native plant. The second part will focus on some highlights of the results, including obscure disused vegetables, native things you can still forage, lost recipes for brewed alcohols and psychoactives, vegetables we've bioengineered for edibility, some exciting natural poisions, and addressing whether or not lettuce really exists.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-461-the-edible-native-plant-project</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1898">Katherine McLean Forster</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-461-the-edible-native-plant-project</url></recording></event><event id="292" guid="88c252c8-56c6-567a-abf5-b4813cb92da1"><room>Stage A</room><title>I Hacked Into My Own Car and other stories</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T17:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/292-i-hacked-into-my-own-car-and-other-stories</url><start>17:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>I'm not a hacker.

I've made examples of logic gates AND OR NOT that I can explain computer science, Archimedes screw, pistons, scissor lifts, engines, gears/ratios, motors/generators, water turbines, conveyor belts and whatever else people can imagine. I love to see them add to it each day and have this long connected machine using all the above and explain where each item is used in every day situations. I'd like this to grow into a live installation, people could label their part like a exhibition of their skill. If possible, it would be great to try make parts of it a marble run. I have lots of wheels, they can have a contest on the last day of who can make their car travel the furthest down a ramp, or balloon/elastic band powered. &#13;
&#13;
I want them to have fun building and seeing things connected, but I'd like to show examples where what they've built takes place. Maybe I could squeeze a bit of my science knowledge of what's going on in too.&#13;
&#13;
I'll keep tweaking this but I wanted to get this idea through to you and I'm happy for suggestions, tweaks. But I'd love to run this and build this continuous connected machine.&#13;
&#13;
I hope you like it. I'd love to run it.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-327-lego-technic-electroengineers</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1763">Christopher Watson </person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="28" guid="8b2350c1-5615-5f4a-bf00-e2178dbe999d"><room>Youth Workshop</room><title>Build and fly a rocket!</title><type>youthworkshop</type><track>youthworkshop</track><date>2024-06-01T11:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/28-build-and-fly-a-rocket</url><start>11:00</start><duration>1:30</duration><abstract>Build and fly a solid-fuelled model rocket from scratch!&#13;
&#13;
We'll provide paper templates and all required materials, you cut and tape the rocket together and then decorate it to taste. Once they're all built we'll take the rockets out to the model flying area and launch them from our launch pad.&#13;
&#13;
Assembling the rocket is straightforward and as they're all made from white card and paper there are plenty of options for decoration or modification. We'll have some helpers on hand to provide guidance.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for young children with supervision. The build involves mostly using scissors and tape, one step involves hot glue which requires adult supervision. Feel free to contact us beforehand if you want to check suitability: emf@adamgreig.com.&#13;
&#13;
There is a limit of one rocket per child.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-28-build-and-fly-a-rocket</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="772">Adam Greig</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="373" guid="1eaca000-50a3-5c3b-bce3-19bd1f3d23b3"><room>Youth Workshop</room><title>Making Lightup Wearables - An Intro to E-textiles!</title><type>youthworkshop</type><track>youthworkshop</track><date>2024-06-01T13:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/373-making-lightup-wearables-an-intro-to-e-textiles</url><start>13:00</start><duration>1:30</duration><abstract>In this session we will follow along step by step to make light-up bracelets and badges for kids using some simple sew-on electronics and conductive thread! &#13;

During the workshop we will also talk about the basics of both sewing and electronic circuits, explaining how to complete a running stitch and how a current flows through a simple circuit to turn on the LED light.&#13;
&#13;
Note: we will be using sewing needles and scissors, so parent or guardian supervision is important!&#13;

Join us for an exciting 60 minute workshop where your child will delve into the world of coding using the innovative BBC Microbit and Neopixels. This hands-on session is tailored to match the Key Stage 3 &amp; 4 computing curriculum, making it a valuable addition to your child&#8217;s education while keeping it fun and engaging. &#13;
In the workshop children will create a simple device that changes the lights, teaching them essential programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. The workshop is more than just a coding lesson; it&#8217;s an introduction to how technology integrates into various aspects of our industries, from manufacturing to creative arts. &#13;
This session is a fantastic way for your child to see the real-world impact of technology and to spark their interest in innovation and tech careers.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-465-300-addressable-led-strings-with-microbits-python</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2041">Robert Wiltshire &amp; Garry Hunt</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="142" guid="955c8041-79f9-5e93-9f7c-a9bed7271dc6"><room>Youth Workshop</room><title>Painting with light - Build and paint with your own "Glowie"</title><type>youthworkshop</type><track>youthworkshop</track><date>2024-06-01T20:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/142-painting-with-light-build-and-paint-with-your-own-glowie</url><start>20:40</start><duration>0:45</duration><abstract>In this evening activity, we will get hands on drawing with light!&#13;

&#13;
Crawlybots were born from talks with Bristol based, robot friends during Covid times, regarding active suspension systems &lt;yawn&gt;.  Many many experimentations later, lead to a Crawly prototype, which 5 mins after turning on, we realised it was not only adept and surmounting any number of challenging terrains... it was also a fantastic dancer!&#13;
&#13;
Funding helped us build a troupe of 4 Crawlybots that we have taken to many public engagement events, and allowed hundreds of kids to take control of the Crawlybots via remote control and FPV drone goggles. The bots bring joy wherever they go, across all ages, even among hard hearted roboticists. &#13;
&#13;
We pride ourselves on having all our robot 'guts' on show, so we can talk about all the great things like Teensys, coding, lipo batteries, BMS's's, esp32s, 3D printing, education, learning through play, sustainability, CNC, laser cutting and all sorts of interesting stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Fun fact! Crawlybot beta # 2 attended EMF 2022 and won the Hacky Races inaugural small robot class!&#13;

&#13;
Come and try Peasgood and Hanslip's vocal transfer models in real-time. &#13;
&#13;
This demo follows from Peasgood and Hanslips talk on creating EverSong (1pm, Stage C). &#13;
&#13;
EverSong is a sound installation where you can hear the lifespan of a person in a song, from 5-years-old at the start to 95-years-old at the end. It explores the fragility of life, its circularity, invites people to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our legacy as humans moving into an increasingly digital age. &#13;
&#13;
Since January 2024, Peasgood &amp; Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC, a newly-developed process which builds on Google Magenta&#8217;s DDSP by combining it with a diffusion-based vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 and trained models which can be mapped onto Emily&#8217;s voice enabling her to sound younger and older than she is. &#13;
&#13;
This technology is starting to be adopted by contemporary pop musicians, high-profile examples being web services such as Grimes&#8217; Elf and Holly Herndon&#8217;s Holly+. &#13;
&#13;
EverSong represents a new application of this technology by making it possible to hear a voice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathways, installed sustainably in nature, touring before finding a permanent home in an ancient site.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-657-eversong-demo</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="192">Emily Peasgood &amp; Mark Hanslip</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="831" guid="6f5f89ed-2985-5d36-8344-358bcbcee0a3"><room>Workshop 0 (Drop-in)</room><title>Richard Wiseman Book Signing</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-06-01T16:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/831-richard-wiseman-book-signing</url><start>16:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Purchase copies of Richard's book from the shop, and bring them to the drop-in workshop tent to get them signed.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-831-richard-wiseman-book-signing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1857">Richard Wiseman</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="519" guid="35b1d961-da98-5ff0-b20a-32829fc0c48f"><room>Workshop 0 (Drop-in)</room><title>Musical Jam Garden 1</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-06-01T17:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/519-musical-jam-garden-1</url><start>17:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Come and join a music jam!

&#8226;	centralize managing your organization&#8217;s users,&#13;
&#8226;	make life easier for your colleagues, and&#13;
&#8226;	enforce consistent security standards.&#13;
But SSO protocols are just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenticated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor &#8220;yeah, that&#8217;s Bob&#8221; doesn&#8217;t tell me what the vendor does with this information, or if the vendor always asks me who&#8217;s coming in the door.&#13;
A bad SSO implementation can make you think you&#8217;re safer, while hiding all the new and fun things that have gone wrong.&#13;
To get the most out of implementing SSO, I need to know what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish and what steps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set up carefully, for each of the things you need to do right, I&#8217;ll give you some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wrong. We all learn from failure, right???&#13;
I&#8217;m sharing this info because this year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at work. It turns out that I&#8217;m good at asking weird questions, and it&#8217;s an extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be, then you know where they could be broken, and you can ask your vendors (and your colleagues!) &#8220;weird questions&#8221; before an adversary does.&#13;

Speak it, of course!&#13;
&#13;
Like many programmers and heavy computer users, I suffer from chronic hand pain aggravated by computer keyboard use (often called repetitive strain injury, or RSI). After having mild symptoms for years, in 2019 my hand pain worsened from irritating to unignorable. Eventually I got desperate enough to try to learn to code by voice. To my surprise, it worked.&#13;
&#13;
Speech recognition technology has advanced dramatically in the past decade, but most people&#8217;s ideas about voice-driven UI are based on highly limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, powerful but imprecise tools like LLMs, or special-purpose dictation tools. What does a voice interface for precise control by expert users look like?&#13;
&#13;
A small but growing community of programmers, many affected by RSI, have been developing tools that explore this question. I use one such tool, called Talon, to control my computer, write and edit computer code, and even to write my dissertation. In this talk, I will live-demo how I edit code by voice, as well as tackling the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
1. What is voice-coding like? What unique challenges does it present?&#13;
2. How do voice control systems like Talon work under the hood?&#13;
3. Could voice coding ever be *better* than typing?&#13;
4. What can we learn from all this about designing voice interfaces for expert users?</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-217-writing-computer-code-by-voice</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1764">Michael Arntzenius</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-217-writing-computer-code-by-voice</url></recording></event><event id="234" guid="e3e29653-61b3-5250-82dd-7c3bed710155"><room>Stage C</room><title>The Tech behind the Tennis - A peek under the hood of a Grand Slam Tennis Tournament</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T11:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/234-the-tech-behind-the-tennis</url><start>11:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>For two weeks every summer, half a million people attend the oldest and most prestigious Tennis Tournament, with another billion people following from afar. Underneath the pristine courts of Wimbledon, a massive technology operation underpins almost every aspect of the event, from the grass growing, to the scores appearing on screens around the world.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will cover the many interesting ways that technology supports this huge live event as well as a behind the scenes peek of the IBM operation in the broadcast centre.&#13;

&#13;
EverSong is a sound installation where you can hear the lifespan of a person in a song, from 5-years-old at the start to 95-years-old at the end. It explores the fragility of life, its circularity, invites people to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our legacy as humans moving into an increasingly digital age. &#13;
&#13;
Since January 2024, Peasgood &amp; Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC, a newly-developed process which builds on Google Magenta&#8217;s DDSP by combining it with a diffusion-based vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 and trained models which can be mapped onto Emily&#8217;s voice enabling her to sound younger and older than she is. &#13;
&#13;
This technology is starting to be adopted by contemporary pop musicians, high-profile examples being web services such as Grimes&#8217; Elf and Holly Herndon&#8217;s Holly+. &#13;
&#13;
EverSong represents a new application of this technology by making it possible to hear a voice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathways, installed sustainably in nature, touring before finding a permanent home in an ancient site.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-120-eversong-singing-voice-transfer</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1317">Emily Peasgood &amp; Mark Hanslip</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-120-eversong-singing-voice-transfer</url></recording></event><event id="160" guid="9920cbba-67ba-5de3-8dc8-8313b8687842"><room>Stage C</room><title>Keeping shell history in sync with turtles and magic</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T14:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/160-keeping-shell-history-in-sync-with-turtles-and-magic</url><start>14:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Atuin is a command line tool for searching and synchronizing shell history across devices. &#13;

You are in cardiac arrest. Your heart has stopped beating, you have stopped breathing, and medically speaking you have died. Not a great start to your day! But worry not: someone has called 999. This talk is the story of that 999 call.&#13;
&#13;
This talk, presented by the CAD &amp; Technical Lead at the London Ambulance Service, will describe everything that happens between dialling 999 and getting to hospital, and all of the technology involved in triaging the call, dispatching the ambulance, and helping patients over the phone before it arrives. This isn't a heartwarming human-interest story from the documentaries &#8212;&#160;this is the full ins and outs of all the systems, processes, and infrastructure that keeps people safe across a major city every day. We'll explore how we use open data to find exactly where you are, exactly how we decide who gets help quickest and who must wait, and how your phone can help save your life. We'll also look at what happens when it all goes wrong, and how we respond to business continuity incidents &#8212; after all, we can't just shut up shop if the system goes down.&#13;
&#13;
Expect high-level conversations about medical emergencies, but this talk is suitable for all ages.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-405-how-to-save-a-life</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="148">Skylar MacDonald</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-405-how-to-save-a-life</url></recording></event><event id="63" guid="061f21ab-f4d9-50c1-b4c9-156e6ada25a0"><room>Stage C</room><title>Creating searchable Post Office Inquiry transcripts</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T15:20:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/63-creating-searchable-post-office-inquiry-transcripts</url><start>15:20</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry was established in 2020, led by retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, to investigate the &#8220;failings which occurred with the Horizon IT system at the Post Office leading to the suspension, termination of subpostmasters&#8217; contracts, prosecution and conviction of subpostmasters&#8221;.&#13;

What happened in the studio era, and why has nothing changed in all the waves of forward movement since? Why, today, do the number of female directors hover around the 10% mark, even after #MeToo and #TimesUp? Female A-list stars still earn only about half as much as their male counterparts, partly because only about 12% of leading roles go to women. Films made by or for women get smaller budgets, smaller releases and smaller marketing spend than male-made equivalents, and the picture is much, much worse for women of colour. So why is this and how do we change things? And why is Barbie such an important step forward?</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-121-women-vs-hollywood</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1318">Helen O'Hara</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-121-women-vs-hollywood</url></recording></event><event id="398" guid="a846c324-63e9-532e-b604-94fd21118acc"><room>Stage C</room><title>Data is plural</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T17:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/398-data-is-plural</url><start>17:00</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>I once accidentally got YouGov to poll whether it should be &#8216;the data is&#8217; or &#8216;the data are&#8217;. &#13;
&#13;
Whether you favour 'are' or 'is', in many ways, data is plural. When we talk about data, we&#8217;re talking about different things, contexts, needs, and perspectives. Thinking of &#8216;data&#8217; as a singular thing brings risks. We always have to set data in a more plural context and can never think about &#8216;just&#8217; the data. And data we think of as being about us &#8211; singular, as individuals &#8211; is often about a plurality of others, and its value &#8211; to governments and tech companies &#8211; is in plurality or aggregate. All of this means we need to rethink our approach to data and take a relational, collective and democratic - a plural, political and human &#8211; approach.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-398-data-is-plural</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1970">Gavin Freeguard</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-398-data-is-plural</url></recording></event><event id="116" guid="cc1e45fe-54c9-58e3-b3f6-21b3cad4c6f4"><room>Stage C</room><title>Cobwebs, snowflakes and crows' feet</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-01T17:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/116-cobwebs-snowflakes-and-crows-feet</url><start>17:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The bicycle wheel is quite possibly the best thing humans have ever invented.&#13;

Inspired by David Graeber's idea of the sustainable activities of play and care, EveryWhere aims to make new rituals around technology that allow the network to exist across generations. In 2022 we convened a group of artists, technologists, designers and activists to start the project. As result of the connections made, we have identified themes and ideas that we will present in this talk. The five themes are Community, Sustainability, Software, Hardware and Creative. Within each of these themes, we've identified four main areas of concern. The purpose of this talk would be to relate our progress up to this point and to galvanise further collaboration with the EMF community.

&#13;
What do impact campaigns accomplish in the creative landscape, and what is the role and responsibility of the media in driving that social impact? Inspired by the film "Don't Look Up", where Benn produced the impact campaign, we will explore this dynamic together. When the ethics are no longer focused on being accurate, but rather being first,and being attention grabbing, it becomes difficult for people to discern what is and is not an important story. So we wonder how some of the most important stories either fall through the ether entirely, or are seen and dismissed by the apparatus of the 24 hour news cycle and 3 second refresh feeds. That's what films like Don't Look Up tackle so well.&#13;

Keep your hands and mind occupied while practising basic macrame knots, and put your newfound knowledge to the test by crafting your very own masterpiece to take home! &#13;
The history of knot-tying traces back to ancient times, with intricate knotting techniques spreading from the Middle East to Spain, Italy, and France. Sailors, especially, embraced macram&#233; for practical purposes during their lengthy sea journeys. The Victorian era witnessed a revival of interest in England, and throughout the 20th century, macram&#233; maintained its popularity with artists and crafters exploring innovative designs and materials. Nowadays the craft has evolved beyond its traditional forms and utilitarian purposes, with contemporary artists pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with knotting techniques.&#13;

We will then watch a short magic show. I will next demonstrate a series of basic card moves and teach tricks you can build on them. We will also learn how to make a ribbon disappear and appear again!&#13;
We will talk about and demonstrate how to make your magic trick delivery build suspense and convince your spectators they are watching something truly magical.&#13;
Finally, I will show the attendees resources so that if they wish, they can continue their magic journeys.&#13;
At the end of the workshop attendees will have the tools to perform a short magic routine (if they practice enough!), and will know what steps to take should they choose to continue doing magic. &#13;
&#13;
*** Please note: This workshop is designed for people who want to perform magic tricks for other people, rather than for those who just want to learn magic secrets. Additionally, if you already have a background in magic tricks (eg. if you already know what a DL and a TT is), this workshop will likely not be that interesting, we will be covering basics. ***</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-227-introduction-to-magic-tricks-cards-more</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1793">Hela Lucas</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="848" guid="5dfcb8bb-dab5-515d-be2e-b576290894a0"><room>Workshop 2 (Milliways)</room><title>Whiskyleaks</title><type>performance</type><track>performance</track><date>2024-06-01T20:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/848-whiskyleaks</url><start>20:30</start><duration>4:00</duration><abstract>Many bottles enter, no bottles leave.&#13;

Are you curious about data science? Taking the first steps in this area is hard, but you don&#8217;t have to do it alone. Join our workshop for complete beginners and get started in Python data science - even if you&#8217;ve never written a single line of code!&#13;
&#13;
We invite you to join us for a fun, supportive workshop that will give you the confidence to get started in this exciting area. You can expect plenty of exercises, as well as inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes. You&#8217;ll cover the basics of programming in Python, as well as useful libraries and tools such as Jupyter notebooks, pandas, and Matplotlib.&#13;
&#13;
In this hands-on workshop, you&#8217;ll work through a series of beginner-friendly materials at your own pace. You&#8217;ll work within small groups, each with an assigned mentor, who will be there to help you with any questions or whenever you get stuck. All you&#8217;ll need to bring is a laptop that can connect to the internet and a willingness to learn!&#13;
&#13;
&#11088; Our goal is to increase inclusivity and provide a safe community for Python and Data Science. We organise free workshops for people who are outside of the mainstream in the data science and tech industry. We therefore encourage those attending to bring a buddy who may not otherwise think of themselves as a "coder" (yet!). &#11088;&#13;

Now with over 700 lasers it is arranged as three self contained units that project onto a white surface 5 to 10 meters away. It requires as much darkness as possible and takes 2/3 hours to set up. The lasers and the motors that turn them (or the object in front of them) are all controlled via midi making it a sort of light organ that creates something nobody has seen before.&#13;

&#13;
Book summary:&#13;
Hex Allen can't do magic - a huge problem when everything from lights to locks is powered by simple spells that everyone (save a few unfortunate "Undevelopeds") can do. After years of feeling useless, Hex seizes the chance to change her future by journeying to the Wishing Wyrm, a legendary dragon that will grant a single wish once a century. Unfortunately, Hex isn't the only one after the wish, and every rival wish hunter has magic on their side. Every rival except the Clanksmiths, Cam and Fuse. Like Hex, they can't do magic, but they've learned to build clank, creations made using the mysterious, forgotten arts of science and engineering.&#13;
&#13;
After a fairy fiasco throws Hex and the Clanksmiths together, they agree to cooperate - for the time being. With the Clanksmiths' know-how and Hex's creativity, they outsmart monsters with everything from LEDs to electromagnets to water balloon launchers. But as they race to the Wishing Wyrm, Hex must decide between her friendship with the Clanksmiths and the wish that would give her a normal, magical life.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-118-hex-allen-and-the-clanksmiths-read-aloud</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="810">Jasmine Florentine</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event></room><room name="Hacky Racers (Track)"><event id="797" guid="d4e848cb-7de8-5e09-a062-a75267157ddb"><room>Hacky Racers (Track)</room><title>Racing!</title><type>performance</type><track>performance</track><date>2024-06-01T11:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/797-racing</url><start>11:00</start><duration>0:15</duration><abstract>Come join us at the Hacky Racers track, behind The Robot Arms, to watch our particular brand of motorsports!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-797-racing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="115">Racing!</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="798" guid="6c6ae882-3116-5a06-b28a-2ec8094ae53b"><room>Hacky Racers (Track)</room><title>Racing!</title><type>performance</type><track>performance</track><date>2024-06-01T12:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/798-racing</url><start>12:00</start><duration>0:15</duration><abstract>Come join us at the Hacky Racers track, behind The Robot Arms, to watch our particular brand of motorsports!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-798-racing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="115">Racing!</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="799" guid="5e7685df-bb9c-5b01-9b25-1cab47de1dea"><room>Hacky Racers (Track)</room><title>Racing!</title><type>performance</type><track>performance</track><date>2024-06-01T13:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/799-racing</url><start>13:00</start><duration>0:15</duration><abstract>Come join us at the Hacky Racers track, behind The Robot Arms, to watch our particular brand of motorsports!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-799-racing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="115">Racing!</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="800" guid="8f53d802-b250-56a9-8e65-cb5d00810804"><room>Hacky Racers (Track)</room><title>(NOT) Racing! </title><type>performance</type><track>performance</track><date>2024-06-01T14:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/800-not-racing</url><start>14:00</start><duration>0:15</duration><abstract>Cancelled as we need more time to recharge batteries and ourselves!&#13;

We will do this with the use of inklewriter which is a narrative scripting program in the browser. This is a tool for making branching dialogue and can connect to game engines, but we will be working with it in the browser. By the end of this session you will have made an epic tale that friends and family alike can play and enjoy. All the while learning how video game story telling is created.&#13;

But if you don't know what it is, or how you can use it to do all sorts of cool things, then this fun and easy workshop is for you. For total beginners! (And anyone who wants to learn more.) As an example project, we'll be creating a TV-B-Gone remote control out of an Arduino you can take home with you. Workshop Itinerary: Intro to Arduino, Very short lesson to learn everything you need to know about electronics, Learn to solder (everyone can learn!), make an Arduino clone from a kit, how to set up the free and open-source Arduino software (Windows, Linux, and MacOS are all fine!), How to program Arduinos, how to read schematic diagrams, Put together your own TV-B-Gone remote control using your Arduino clone board using a solderless breadboard. Target practice is available all over the world after the workshop.&#13;

We have a studio in London where we do pen plotting, tinkering, crafting, and making with robots and machines. You&#8217;re welcome to join me at our van (what3words: smoker.evolution.coolest) for interactive ad-hoc crafting sessions and a friendly chat on all things crafting, cutting, vinyl, heat pressing, or even pen plotters if you&#8217;re interested.&#13;
&#13;
**We are located in NE Camping Vehicles. There is now a pin on the digital map with our location. Please stop by here!**&#13;
&#13;
I&#8217;m happy to let you get involved in designing and pressing, or watch and learn. &#13;
&#13;
I will have a variety of supplies on hand, including types of vinyl, heat transfer, infusible ink, and adhesive vinyl. I can discuss the differences between all of these and the sorts of projects you might consider each one for.&#13;
&#13;
We intend on hosting you at our camper van, wherever we&#8217;re parked, but if you&#8217;re interested or have questions, you&#8217;re welcome to fill in this form and I can keep you posted on where we&#8217;ll be:&#13;
&#13;
https://forms.gle/qe8rhssk87bFrgMZ7&#13;
&#13;
- I can help customise something you already have for &#163;5 - be it a cotton shirt, a mug, a water bottle, or a tumbler, I will have supplies available to customise something you already have on hand - If you have a blank cotton t-shirt and an SVG design file, we can even look at creating a logo or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (one colour designs only). There is a cost of &#163;5 per item to cover supplies, but it could be a fun way to bring new life into something you already have. Mugs and tumblers will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I have. I have a variety of colours, including foil designs to customise with. Please bring supplies with you for this, I will not have anything extra. For T-shirts, any cotton shirt will do; I usually pick mine up from Tesco or Sainsbury&#8217;s, where they have many options in different colours.&#13;
&#13;
If you&#8217;re interested in designing something new, I will have a small variety of blanks available for customisation and purchase while stocks last.&#13;
- 12 oz coffee mugs (&#163;12) - You can use sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs suitable for cutting out, or I have some infusible ink pens for drawn designs that would work great with these mugs&#13;
- Accessory bags (large: &#163;20; and small: &#163;18): I can customise these bags using Heat Transfer vinyl, which is great for monograms or simple designs. I have access to a design library if you need ideas for what to include with your bag designs. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags with a navy blue base and natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in black, natural, navy, or pink. I have a couple of pre-made options available too.&#13;
- 20 oz skinny tumblers (&#163;30) - Using sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs, these are great for cut-out designs&#13;
- Sublimation t-shirts (&#163;24) (Small&#8212;large sizes; I have some XL, but I think they run small, so please check with me on sizes)&#8212;These are sublimation t-shirt blanks and would work with the infusible ink transfer sheets and infusible ink pens. Also, if you&#8217;re curious why you can do sublimation on some shirts but not on others, come by and chat with me about the different materials.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-740-cutting-machines-vinyl-pressing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2419">Heidi Blanton from Forge &amp; Craft</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="746" guid="bdb3f379-19c9-5d53-a2cd-74977fc91dcf"><room>Lounge</room><title>EMF goes Geo - come and chat geospatial stuff with us</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-06-01T13:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/746-emf-goes-geo-come-and-chat-geospatial-stuff-with-us</url><start>13:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Come and chat about geospatial stuff at EMF.

&#13;
If you&#8217;ve written a novel or work of non-fiction that you&#8217;d like to get traditionally published, but you aren&#8217;t sure of the next steps, then come find me in the lounge. I&#8217;ll give you some pointers for how to find and approach the right agents for your work, answer any questions you might have about how the publishing industry works, or if you don&#8217;t have specific questions in mind, we can just have a chat about books.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-820-navigating-the-publishing-industry-drop-in-session</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2365">Bryony Woods</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="775" guid="e94ea2cf-c0e8-5ff2-a87f-3c20fe20a9db"><room>Lounge</room><title>Climate Action Tech Meetup</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-06-01T14:30:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/775-climate-action-tech-meetup</url><start>14:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>ClimateAction.tech is a community of tech workers that provides support and guidance for systemic change in our organisations and industries, to face the climate crisis.

Our project explores mums&#8217; experiences of baby feeding decisions. The interactive project is inspired by the Welsh quilting tradition, bringing communities together through crafting, whilst digital touch points stitched into the quilt allow mothers stories to be heard. &#13;
If you want you can give us some feedback about the way it make you feel through a survey. &#13;
&#13;
The stories embedded in the quilt range from positive and uplifting to potentially distressing, including mention of illness, birth complications and feeding problems.

&#13;
Everyone is welcome to bring along their synths, sequencers, stylophones, spectrums, and signal generators of any kind to play a ten minute live gig on the Null Sector sound system to an audience of curious people.&#13;
&#13;
EMOM operates on a first-come-first-served basis, with a sign-up sheet opening 30 minutes before the first performance and sign-ups remaining open until we have no more time left! Remember to write your name on the sheet.&#13;
&#13;
We will call people to play their 10 minute slots in order, with the next person setting up while someone plays. If you are not there to play when called we will skip to the next performer.&#13;
&#13;
We can provide a single DI input for your equipment and a microphone. Please make sure you bring everything you need to connect to the sound setup. If you are not sure you can do this, please email music@emfcamp.org&#13;

It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one German Apfelweine,&#13;
&#13;
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs &#13;

&#13;
Details of what to expect: https://s.ai/emf#workshop&#13;
&#13;
Starting location is between the cluster of 4 trees south of the lounge: https://map.emfcamp.org/#18.65/52.0411454/-2.3770934&#13;
&#13;
Timing: The times listed in the conference schedule are not real &#8212; they're only a placeholder. I expect to do 1 a day, Thursday through Sunday. I'll email you as soon as I'm able (which might be day-of), to tell you when to come after I decide actual times &#8212; based on responses to the sign-up form, group coordination, my own schedule &amp; spoons, brightness, &amp; weather. I am not likely to be able to do more than 1/day other than for special circumstances, nor before twilight, but that's TBD.&#13;
&#13;
## Mandatory:&#13;
* Sign up using the form at https://s.ai/emf/ws&#13;
* Be completely sober.&#13;
* Have at least 1.5 hours free (preferably 2).&#13;
* Watch my CCC talk about this: https://s.ai/ccc You'll learn much more if we can focus on what I can't show in the talk.&#13;
&#13;
## Very strongly encouraged: &#13;
* Bring a friend or prior participant to act as your assistant, and sign up as one to pass it on to others. The two experiences are very different, and are both valuable &#8212; and I can't teach as many people simultaneously without help.&#13;
* Pee, drink, and wash your hands beforehand.&#13;
* Wear clothing that leaves head and arms uncovered, and thin shoes that let you feel the ground.&#13;
* Give feedback afterwards at https://s.ai/emf/fb&#13;
* Use a group coordination code on the sign-up form to get scheduled with your friends etc.&#13;
&#13;
## Special:&#13;
I may run additional bespoke workshops, at different times, if you:&#13;
1. have visual impairment that may benefit from cane use, whether or not you've had O&amp;M;&#13;
2. have other disabilities that would benefit from doing this 1-on-1 (e.g. Deaf or wheelchair user);&#13;
3. work professionally with cane users or in very low visibility environments;&#13;
4. are part of EMF staff, volunteers, etc.;&#13;
5. can video record the workshop (e.g. stabilised GoPro), or participate on camera; or&#13;
6. have some other good reason for me to do an extra session or in a bespoke manner.&#13;
&#13;
If any of that applies to you, please indicate it on the sign-up form, and include all times that could work for you &#8212; including day 0 (Thursday).&#13;
&#13;
## Weather&#13;
&#13;
If it's raining, or the ground is still muddy from recent rain, the workshop will be cancelled. &#13;

&#13;
Tuaca, the Italian spiced brandy-vanilla liqueur, first reached British shores in the 1960s. Everyone in Brighton will tell you a different story about how it got here, and why you&#8217;ll only ever find it on the south coast. Was it really first produced for Lorenzo the Magnificent? Did the salesman who brought it to the UK really just enjoy Brighton so much that he stayed? Is Brighton really responsible for 90% of all Tuaca sales?&#13;
&#13;
The answers to all these questions and more lie at the bottom of a sticky, cinnamon-sweet shot glass. Come and enjoy a taste of Brighton culture!**&#13;

This is the story of how Open Source helped save lives.&#13;
&#13;
Come and learn about how we convinced the NHS to open source the app. What pitfalls there were. How we allayed security concerns. What went wrong. How we dealt with trolls. And why it was so important to be as transparent as possible.&#13;
&#13;
This talk asks if we did the right thing? Should have done something differently? Could we have been more open? Were the risks justified? Was being Open Source a help or hindrance?&#13;

&#13;
The speaker will begin by sharing her journey in social impact games and its landscape, focusing on activism initiatives in games. She will draw examples primarily from the UN&#8217;s Playing for the Planet&#8217;s Green Game Jam which includes ustwo games&#8217; Monument Valley 2's The Lost Forest. Surveys from the jam reveal how games can spur positive actions in real life.&#13;
&#13;
Then we take action -- through play. In this RPG-lite / communal storytelling experience curated by the speaker, a few volunteers will take on special roles to battle a dragon turned to the darkside. We&#8217;ll meet in our imaginary tavern and adventure together to save the world!&#13;
&#13;
Let&#8217;s play and change the world together.&#13;

Today, we wield the power to effect changes from a tent, a bedroom or an office the likes of which fifty years ago one might need the power of a small nation-state to accomplish.&#13;
&#13;
Having seen these systems from all angles - building the tech, researching digital consent academically, and fighting biased public sector algorithms in the media and the courts - I'm confident that we really haven&#8217;t adapted to that reality. In the choices we make in technical practice, we find ourselves paving the road to hell with our good intentions.&#13;
&#13;
Most of us aren't trained in ethics, policy or politics - so how do we manage the weighty burden of being responsible for people&#8217;s safety? What can we do &#8211; both as individuals and as a society as a whole &#8211; to try and stop algorithmic harms? And, how do we stop our robots from killing us?</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-355-dont-be-evil-by-accident-algorithmic-harms-and-ethics</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="101">Curtis Parfitt-Ford</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-355-dont-be-evil-by-accident-algorithmic-harms-and-ethics</url></recording></event><event id="538" guid="31139da9-a829-5e2e-9005-b2f431116b9b"><room>Stage A</room><title>Contrary to popular belief, tech needs unions</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T13:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/538-contrary-to-popular-belief-tech-needs-unions</url><start>13:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>It's no secret that the tech sector is notoriously lacking in unionisation compared to more traditional industries; We'd like to talk about why this might be, why it's a bad thing for everyone, and how we might go about fixing it.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-538-contrary-to-popular-belief-tech-needs-unions</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2035">United Tech &amp; Allied Workers</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event id="449" guid="9fe460d6-5378-5bd9-84f8-dc921b03d227"><room>Stage A</room><title>Badge Talk</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T14:20:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/449-badge-talk</url><start>14:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>In which the badge team have a natter about the tildagon badge, the hexpansion format, the development process, pitfalls and panics along the way.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-449-badge-talk</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1310">The Badge Team</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-449-badge-talk</url></recording></event><event id="156" guid="d33b60e7-cfb8-5784-bd79-5657c32af2de"><room>Stage A</room><title>Living on the canals of the UK - Lessons from the water</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T15:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/156-living-on-the-canals-of-the-uk-lessons-from-the-water</url><start>15:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The canals of the UK have undergone transformation from industry to decay to leisure and in recent years to housing. &#13;

&#13;
Today, the railway system is now part public part private, leaving plenty of confusion for passengers.&#13;
&#13;
Who runs your local station? Who sets the rail fares, and who covers your refund? And where the hell does HS1 and HS2 fit into all this? I will take you through how the UK rail organisations are structured, who does and owns what, and how does this affect passengers?&#13;
&#13;
- What's the difference between Network Rail and National Rail? &#13;
- How does split ticketing work? &#13;
- What did Labour announce in April?&#13;
&#13;
And most importantly: &#13;
Who should I be angry at when I'm crammed in sideways on a delayed Sunday afternoon train to Leeds?&#13;
&#13;
No knowledge of the rail industry is required to enjoy this talk, but experts will find it depressing. &#13;
&#13;
I may swear, mostly about MPs.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-375-thomas-the-privatised-tank-engine-30-years-on</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1952">Ashley Rolfmore</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-375-thomas-the-privatised-tank-engine-30-years-on</url></recording></event><event id="199" guid="5f069572-a15b-5da2-ae3e-d047d288983d"><room>Stage A</room><title>Driving fancy LED panels with commodity hardware</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T17:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/199-driving-fancy-led-panels-with-commodity-hardware</url><start>17:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Ever wondered about what's behind large advertising billboards? Interested in pretty blinking lights? Curious about electronics and circuit board design? This talk might be for you!&#13;
&#13;
Our hackspace recently got a donation of ~800 LED matrix panels (squares with lots of tiny LEDs on them), with little in the way of documentation. I'll explain how they work, how we got them to light up and display things, and how to make it fast enough to display 30fps video -- all with commodity parts that cost less than 20 pounds.&#13;
&#13;
We'll explore the weird and wonderful world of poorly translated datasheets and control software, marvel at the library of weird glitched-out images I ended up with on the road to success, and dive into the strange but extremely useful Programmable I/O block of the RP2040 microcontroller. If the stars align, you'll be able to see everything working on a real demonstration panel, too!&#13;
&#13;
Although we'll be going into detail on some bits, this talk should be accessible to most audiences. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-199-driving-fancy-led-panels-with-commodity-hardware</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="90">eta</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-199-driving-fancy-led-panels-with-commodity-hardware</url></recording></event><event id="552" guid="04795634-2cdf-51da-a0d6-15440e6c6fb6"><room>Stage A</room><title>Infrastructure Review</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T18:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/552-infrastructure-review</url><start>18:00</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>Members of the EMF infrastructure teams (network, power, lighting, video, telephony) will talk about how we made the event happen this year.

&#13;
I now work in the space industry but began my journey into engineering just six years ago by joining a makerspace. Using examples from my own experience - plus some history - I&#8217;ll examine how the skills you can pick up as a maker translate over to the space sector, how there are plenty of similarities between hobbyist making and professional space engineering, and how Makerspaces teach skills that are actually in great demand in professional engineering!&#13;
&#13;
Where there isn't a direct link from makerspaces into professional work, I'd like to go briefly into what skills you should look to pick up, and how to do it, if want you to go for a space job!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-129-from-makerspace-to-outer-space</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1339">Neil Monteiro</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-129-from-makerspace-to-outer-space</url></recording></event><event id="325" guid="4accfd0c-212e-5946-9d02-401eec59bfde"><room>Stage B</room><title>I FOI'd every NHS board in England on autism assessment provision: here's how it went</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T10:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/325-i-foid-every-nhs-board-in-england-on-autism-assessment</url><start>10:40</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>In December 2023, 172,022 people were waiting for an autism assessment. We know this because NHS England publish quarterly national and regional statistics on the size of the waiting list. What we *don't* know is how long they're waiting for, how many ultimately get a diagnosis, what the referral process is like, or what support (if any) is given afterwards - all of which is a postcode lottery.&#13;
&#13;
I lead policy at Autistica, the UK's leading autism research and campaigning charity. I am also autistic myself, which sometimes manifests as a chronic inability to give up. That's why, on 14th March, I sent the same Freedom of Information Act request to all 42 NHS Integrated Care Boards in England.&#13;
&#13;
What started as firing off a few e-mails turned very complicated very quickly; this is a whistle-stop tour of redirection, confusion, and private outsourcing. Over eleven weeks on, I *hope* I'll be able to present a national overview of the growing crisis facing autistic people and their loved ones - and what we need to do about it.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-325-i-foid-every-nhs-board-in-england-on-autism-assessment</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1153">Georgia Harper</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="347" guid="9971d84f-f412-5a06-90a7-f6ea084063a0"><room>Stage B</room><title>Making sense of London Underground's timetables and real-time data</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T11:10:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/347-making-sense-of-london-undergrounds-timetables</url><start>11:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Building on a talk by eta from EMF 2022, this is a deeper dive into how to make use of London Underground's real-time data and hard-to-access timetables to predict a train's future actions.&#13;

&#13;
You can still buy the film, and it's a lot of fun shooting a real movie, but it's not cheap.

&#13;
I will briefly describe the anatomy of a rocket engine and why the extreme conditions it must endure make designing one hard, and then introduce powder metal 3D printing and how you print an engine. I work for a company in this field, and I will show various images and videos of our engines being fired, as well as the engines themselves so that people can have a look, and some samples with internal cutaways to show the internal structures that 3D printing technology now makes relatively easy. &#13;
&#13;
I will also discuss drawbacks and common failure-modes of 3D printing for rocket engines, and talk about where new advances in the field might take us, such as multi-metal prints, hybrid machining, and other exciting technologies.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-131-how-to-3d-print-a-rocket-engine</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1347">Ed Moore</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-131-how-to-3d-print-a-rocket-engine</url></recording></event><event id="193" guid="a692aaa1-a6d6-5184-ae7c-096e02badcd2"><room>Stage B</room><title>How to get anything from anywhere to anywhere</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T16:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/193-how-to-get-anything-from-anywhere-to-anywhere</url><start>16:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>You have an object / art installation/auction purchase and want it somewhere else? What are the options of getting it there without breaking yourself?&#13;
&#13;
This will be a short, hopefully entertaining, overview of transport options, their financial and environmental impact and the time they take. This talk is based on examples of personal experience sending hacky art installations around Europe and the globe.&#13;
&#13;
By doing this many questions had to be answered for example:&#13;
- how big are doors?&#13;
- why acessability regulayions are great or not?&#13;
- what fits in an elevator?&#13;
- how much fits in a van?&#13;
- what fit&#8217;s in a cargo aeroplane?&#13;
&#13;
There will be dragons! Along the way we&#8217;ll encounter customs officers, new excitement around rules for international road haulage, air freight and how astronomically long container shipping takes. &#13;

I intend for this workshop to be useful to people who have never worked with leather before and would like to learn the skills needed to start making or repairing leather goods.&#13;
&#13;
I will discuss the three main types of leather and which to choose; the basic tools you will need to start making leather goods (and how to use them); how to dye leather; how to attach eyelets, rivets, and buckles; and the three main types of stitch.&#13;
&#13;
For the practical part of the workshop, you will be sewing a leather keyring using one of the most common types of stitch. Saddle Stitch uses one piece of thread with a needle at each end to create a stitch line that is both beautiful and resilient. The leather, thread, and tools needed to create your keyring will all be provided.&#13;

&#13;
During the workshop you'll...&#13;
-Cut and fold the parts for the robot from paper&#13;
-Connect the servo that drives the robot's arms to the BBC micro:bit&#13;
-Program the micro:bit using block code&#13;
-Decorate your robot to give it a personality&#13;
&#13;
Whether you're completely new to robotics or an expert, this is a chance to have some fun blending art with engineering, and to be inspired by how household materials like paper can be combined with simple electronics to build fully functional robots. &#13;
&#13;
You can either borrow a micro:bit for the duration of the workshop or bring your own. &#13;
Note that if you borrow a micro:bit, you'll be able to keep your robot but you'll need to supply your own micro:bit at home to get it back up and running. &#13;

The most successful robots are those which are truly &#8216;heboi&#8217;, meaning technically poor or low in quality. These are bots constructed without the technology or skill that you&#8217;d usually expect in a robot fighting tournament.&#13;
&#13;
Join us to build robots, ready to compete in this years Hebocon!&#13;
The first round of the competition will be in this workshop from 12:00 - 13:00. The winners of the first round will be competing on Stage C from 14:00-14:40, so make sure you're free then. You are also welcome to build a robot just for the fun of it.&#13;

&#13;
In this talk, we'll take a journey together to look at one aspect of computer history - creative technology and art - and the ways in which it has been misunderstood and feared at different points in our shared history and culture. Along the way, you'll also hear about how I accidentally became an artist, after being laid off from my dream job with big tech; the story of building my own pen plotters; and, how you can make your own army of art robots!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-302-where-is-the-art-pen-plotters</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="1036">Andy Piper</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-302-where-is-the-art-pen-plotters</url></recording></event><event id="549" guid="c04dc286-882d-56cf-b6a9-affc9b7d266d"><room>Stage C</room><title>Lightning talks  (Sunday)</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T11:40:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/549-lightning-talks-sunday</url><start>11:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Short 10 minute talks on any topic</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-549-lightning-talks-sunday</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2">Thor</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-549-lightning-talks-sunday</url></recording></event><event id="60" guid="527d6f4b-910a-5d1f-b6e3-9aa67f5c2f0a"><room>Stage C</room><title>An engineer&#8217;s guide to parenthood</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T12:20:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/60-an-engineer-s-guide-to-parenthood</url><start>12:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>A lot has happened at the other end of life since the last EMF camp; pregnancy, birth and adjusting to life with a tiny human.&#13;

Beyond this, it's surprisingly rare to find good information beyond the basic physics and the marketing promise of unlimited, clean energy.&#13;
&#13;
As an engineer working in the fusion technology sector, I give a primer on how fusion power works, why its benefits are so incredibly tantalising yet hard to achieve, what the latest exciting developments are, and how the UK is a surprising trailblazer. I outline some of the cutting-edge technologies involved in developing fusion power, including superconducting magnets, plasma control using deep learning methods, and hypersonic fuel injection. The audience is also given facts and figures to get a flavour of the unimaginable scale of what is being done: materials at nearly 0K adjacent to plasmas hotter than the cores of stars, gigawatts of power from teaspoons of fuel, magnetic fields multiple times more powerful than MRI machines, and neutron fluxes strong enough to transmute matter in bulk.&#13;
&#13;
Coming away from this presentation, the audience will have learned about the fundamentals of nuclear fusion and appreciate the key issues enough to put the marketing and news reports into context. They might even be excited and enthused about what's to come in this quickly growing technology space.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-471-unlimited-power</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="968">James Pope</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>false</optout><url>https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-471-unlimited-power</url></recording></event><event id="96" guid="07db0746-607c-5eb1-b050-d4ff51cfff52"><room>Stage C</room><title>A country you can't put in a box.</title><type>talk</type><track>talk</track><date>2024-06-02T16:50:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/96-a-country-you-cant-put-in-a-box</url><start>16:50</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>A talk about the difficulties of geospatial analysis when the country you are interested is on the edge of the world map.

&#13;
- I can help customise something you already have for &#163;5 - be it a cotton shirt, a mug, a water bottle, or a tumbler, I will have supplies available to customise something you already have on hand - If you have a blank cotton t-shirt and an SVG design file, we can even look at creating a logo or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (one colour designs only). There is a cost of &#163;5 per item to cover supplies, but it could be a fun way to bring new life into something you already have. Mugs and tumblers will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I have. I have a variety of colours, including foil designs to customise with. Please bring supplies with you for this, I will not have anything extra. For T-shirts, any cotton shirt will do; I usually pick mine up from Tesco or Sainsbury&#8217;s, where they have many options in different colours.&#13;
&#13;
If you&#8217;re interested in designing something new, I will have a small variety of blanks available for customisation and purchase while stocks last.&#13;
- 12 oz coffee mugs (&#163;12) - You can use sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs suitable for cutting out, or I have some infusible ink pens for drawn designs that would work great with these mugs&#13;
- Accessory bags (large: &#163;20; and small: &#163;18): I can customise these bags using Heat Transfer vinyl, which is great for monograms or simple designs. I have access to a design library if you need ideas for what to include with your bag designs. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags with a navy blue base and natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in black, natural, navy, or pink. I have a couple of pre-made options available too.&#13;
- 20 oz skinny tumblers (&#163;30) - Using sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs, these are great for cut-out designs&#13;
- Sublimation t-shirts (&#163;24) (Small&#8212;large sizes; I have some XL, but I think they run small, so please check with me on sizes)&#8212;These are sublimation t-shirt blanks and would work with the infusible ink transfer sheets and infusible ink pens. Also, if you&#8217;re curious why you can do sublimation on some shirts but not on others, come by and chat with me about the different materials.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-741-cutting-machines-vinyl-pressing</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="2419">Heidi Blanton from Forge &amp; Craft</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event id="858" guid="9f639aa0-f350-55b8-9e75-22cbf75569b5"><room>Lounge</room><title>LOG POTS - Sustainable planters and pots from logs - DROP IN</title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-06-02T14:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/858-log-pots-sustainable-planters-and-pots-from-logs-drop-in</url><start>14:00</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>Drop in workshop  to learn how to make a simple sustainable pot/planter from a log and some wire and nails, using traditional green wood working techniques with simple tools. &#13;
&#13;
We will setup outside the lounge area.&#13;
&#13;
Limitiations on tool availability means this is a sequential, one at a time instructed workshop. &#13;
&#13;
Hopefully each pot will take less than 1/2 an hour to complete.&#13;
&#13;
Will involve hitting things hard with mallets and hammers!&#13;
&#13;
We have enough materials to make 6 pots, so when they've gone, they've gone.&#13;
&#13;
Hope to see you there, Surrey and Hampshire Makerspace( SHM ).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
We're going to launch a very large balloon up to the edge of space*.&#13;
After a brief introduction to high altitude ballooning from Dave in the village (plus a safety briefing), we'll walk out to an open area of field, fill a very large balloon with helium, check the flight computers and let go! The balloon will then drift up to 25km+, eventually bursting and falling back down to earth.&#13;
All the while, we'll be able to track it live on the map, while even hopefully receive some images from the edge of space*.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thanks to Dave from the AMSAT-UK / BATC / UKuG village for making this activity possible.&#13;
&#13;
(* And yes, we know balloons don't actually go to the edge of space, but it's still going to be a lot higher than even commercial planes fly!)&#13;

It's a unique, permanent sensory upgrade you can still use when sighted.&#13;
&#13;
Details of what to expect: https://s.ai/emf#workshop&#13;
&#13;
Starting location is between the cluster of 4 trees south of the lounge: https://map.emfcamp.org/#18.65/52.0411454/-2.3770934&#13;
&#13;
Timing: The times listed in the conference schedule are not real &#8212; they're only a placeholder. I expect to do 1 a day, Thursday through Sunday. I'll email you as soon as I'm able (which might be day-of), to tell you when to come after I decide actual times &#8212; based on responses to the sign-up form, group coordination, my own schedule &amp; spoons, brightness, &amp; weather. I am not likely to be able to do more than 1/day other than for special circumstances, nor before twilight, but that's TBD.&#13;
&#13;
## Mandatory:&#13;
* Sign up using the form at https://s.ai/emf/ws&#13;
* Be completely sober.&#13;
* Have at least 1.5 hours free (preferably 2).&#13;
* Watch my CCC talk about this: https://s.ai/ccc You'll learn much more if we can focus on what I can't show in the talk.&#13;
&#13;
## Very strongly encouraged: &#13;
* Bring a friend or prior participant to act as your assistant, and sign up as one to pass it on to others. The two experiences are very different, and are both valuable &#8212; and I can't teach as many people simultaneously without help.&#13;
* Pee, drink, and wash your hands beforehand.&#13;
* Wear clothing that leaves head and arms uncovered, and thin shoes that let you feel the ground.&#13;
* Give feedback afterwards at https://s.ai/emf/fb&#13;
* Use a group coordination code on the sign-up form to get scheduled with your friends etc.&#13;
&#13;
## Special:&#13;
I may run additional bespoke workshops, at different times, if you:&#13;
1. have visual impairment that may benefit from cane use, whether or not you've had O&amp;M;&#13;
2. have other disabilities that would benefit from doing this 1-on-1 (e.g. Deaf or wheelchair user);&#13;
3. work professionally with cane users or in very low visibility environments;&#13;
4. are part of EMF staff, volunteers, etc.;&#13;
5. can video record the workshop (e.g. stabilised GoPro), or participate on camera; or&#13;
6. have some other good reason for me to do an extra session or in a bespoke manner.&#13;
&#13;
If any of that applies to you, please indicate it on the sign-up form, and include all times that could work for you &#8212; including day 0 (Thursday).&#13;
&#13;
## Weather&#13;
&#13;
If it's raining, or the ground is still muddy from recent rain, the workshop will be cancelled. &#13;
&#13;
There's one exception: if you have visual impairment, it's still on. (You need to know how to get around no matter what the weather is.)</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2024-564-sense-without-sight-blind-navigation-hands-on-workshop</slug><subtitle></subtitle><persons><person id="920">Sai</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event></room><room name="Astralship"><event id="857" guid="acd457f1-918c-56db-92bb-0b148ee2872e"><room>Astralship</room><title>Language synthesis </title><type>workshop</type><track>workshop</track><date>2024-06-02T16:00:00+01:00</date><url>https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/857-language-synthesis</url><start>16:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Sit down conversation about synthesising new human languages using LLMs, to better represent a lingua franca for humanity.&#13;
