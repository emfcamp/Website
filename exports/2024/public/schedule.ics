SUMMARY:How I found a Roman Villa (or temple)

DESCRIPTION:The Roman archaeological record is far from complete\; There a
 re hundreds of high status Roman buildings yet to be located in Britain. \
 n\nI was volunteering in the ambulance service during COVID when I was giv
 en a piece of Roman pottery by a patient. With no training (I later embark
 ed on an Archaeology degree )\, I started to carefully investigate and rec
 ord what is now established as an enigmatic high-status Roman building - c
 omplete with mosaic\, painted wall plaster and hypocaust. \n\nMy talk will
  demonstrate some free Web-based tools that you can use to investigate you
 r local landscape (LiDAR\, etc.). It will also show you non-invasive ways 
 to survey and record archaeological sites. Finally\, I'll have some Roman 
 artefacts to handle.\n\n\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/

SUMMARY:CHERI and Arm Morello: mitigating the terrible legacy of memory-sa
 fety security issues\, in practice at scale
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/London;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20240531T173000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/London;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20240531T180000
UID:2024-87
DESCRIPTION:Computing is riddled with security vulnerabilities\, many of w
 hich arise from memory safety issues.  Conventional hardware architectures
  and the C/C++ codebase are chronically prone to exploitable errors - a 75
 -year-old problem at the heart of computing.  \n\nThis talk will introduce
  CHERI\, showing how (finally?!) we can do better.  The CHERI research pro
 ject has developed a new architecture+software approach\, using unforgeabl
 e hardware capabilities to implement pointers. Morello is an Arm experimen
 tal platform for evaluation of CHERI to explore its potential for mass-mar
 ket adoption\, part-funded by the UKRI Digital Security by Design programm
 e\, and other groups are developing CHERI-enabled RISC-V processors\, incl
 uding Microsoft\, Google\, lowRISC\, SCI Semiconductor\, Codasip\, and RIS
 C-V International. \n\nThis talk will introduce the problem\, and CHERI an
 d Morello\, for a broad audience: the hardware extensions\, their potentia
 l for fine-grained memory safety and software compartmentalisation\, the C
 HERI software stack\, and machine-checked mathematical proof that the arch
 itecture design provides the intended security. CHERI complements alternat
 ive high-level-language approaches\, that would need code to be rewritten 
 from scratch\, and we'll talk about the often-low cost of porting code to 
 CHERI. \n\nI'll demo how CHERI prevents exploitable memory safety errors o
 n a Morello box\,  running Arm CHERI hardware and a complete CHERI softwar
 e stack.\n\nThis is joint work by the CHERI and Morello teams at the Unive
 rsity of Cambridge\, Arm\, SRI International\, and the University of Edinb
 urgh. \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/87-cheri-and-arm-mor

SUMMARY:I FOI'd every NHS board in England on autism assessment provision:
  here's how it went

DESCRIPTION:In December 2023\, 172\,022 people were waiting for an autism 
 assessment. We know this because NHS England publish quarterly national an
 d regional statistics on the size of the waiting list. What we *don't* kno
 w is how long they're waiting for\, how many ultimately get a diagnosis\, 
 what the referral process is like\, or what support (if any) is given afte
 rwards - all of which is a postcode lottery.\n\nI lead policy at Autistica
 \, the UK's leading autism research and campaigning charity. I am also aut
 istic myself\, which sometimes manifests as a chronic inability to give up
 . That's why\, on 14th March\, I sent the same Freedom of Information Act 
 request to all 42 NHS Integrated Care Boards in England.\n\nWhat started a
 s firing off a few e-mails turned very complicated very quickly\; this is 
 a whistle-stop tour of redirection\, confusion\, and private outsourcing. 
 Over eleven weeks on\, I *hope* I'll be able to present a national overvie
 w of the growing crisis facing autistic people and their loved ones - and 
 what we need to do about it.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/202

DESCRIPTION:We want to build a flock of beautiful\, unique\, singing\, com
 municating birds.\n\nYour bird will come and join the flock. We'll show yo
 u how to write your first micro:bit program\, how to play with different w
 ays to make cool sounds\, and then how to make your bird a social beast\, 
 responding to wireless signals from the flock.\n\nWe want you to come and 
 teach your bird how to squeak\, squawk\, sqauck\, quack or even beatbox.\n
 \nYou will need to bring a laptop\nWe'll provide the micro:bits\, batterie
 s\, cables and craft materials.\n\nIf you have your own micro:bit (V2)\, b
 ring it along so you can keep your bird at the end of the festival. if you
  have servo motors\, bring them along and you can make a bird that flaps.\
 n\nYou can code in MicroPython or MakeCode (which is like Scratch)\n\nAt t
 he end of the activity we will find a nice tree to hang the birds up somew
 here people can come and see\, hear and admire them.\n\n\nAttending this w
 orkshop will cost: Free but you can't keep the micro:bit\, sorry.\nSuitabl
 e age range: 8+\nAttendees should bring: Laptop with USB ports (C or A). H
 eadphones might be helpful. Wired best. (optional: own micro:bit V2 if you
  have one\, servos if you want flapping)\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/

DESCRIPTION:What does a computer programmer do if they can’t type code? 
 Speak it\, of course!\n\nLike many programmers and heavy computer users\, 
 I suffer from chronic hand pain aggravated by computer keyboard use (often
  called repetitive strain injury\, or RSI). After having mild symptoms for
  years\, in 2019 my hand pain worsened from irritating to unignorable. Eve
 ntually I got desperate enough to try to learn to code by voice. To my sur
 prise\, it worked.\n\nSpeech recognition technology has advanced dramatica
 lly in the past decade\, but most people’s ideas about voice-driven UI a
 re based on highly limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa\, powerful 
 but imprecise tools like LLMs\, or special-purpose dictation tools. What d
 oes a voice interface for precise control by expert users look like?\n\nA 
 small but growing community of programmers\, many affected by RSI\, have b
 een developing tools that explore this question. I use one such tool\, cal
 led Talon\, to control my computer\, write and edit computer code\, and ev
 en to write my dissertation. In this talk\, I will live-demo how I edit co
 de by voice\, as well as tackling the following questions:\n\n1. What is v
 oice-coding like? What unique challenges does it present?\n2. How do voice
  control systems like Talon work under the hood?\n3. Could voice coding ev
 er be *better* than typing?\n4. What can we learn from all this about desi
 gning voice interfaces for expert users?\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/

SUMMARY:Unlimited Power: An Engineer's Low-Down on Nuclear Fusion Technolo

DESCRIPTION:Most technical people hear about fusion power in the news or s
 ee it in games and movies\, and are familiar with the joke that it's alway
 s 20 years away. Beyond this\, it's surprisingly rare to find good informa
 tion beyond the basic physics and the marketing promise of unlimited\, cle
 an energy.\n\nAs an engineer working in the fusion technology sector\, I g
 ive a primer on how fusion power works\, why its benefits are so incredibl
 y tantalising yet hard to achieve\, what the latest exciting developments 
 are\, and how the UK is a surprising trailblazer. I outline some of the cu
 tting-edge technologies involved in developing fusion power\, including su
 perconducting magnets\, plasma control using deep learning methods\, and h
 ypersonic fuel injection. The audience is also given facts and figures to 
 get a flavour of the unimaginable scale of what is being done: materials a
 t nearly 0K adjacent to plasmas hotter than the cores of stars\, gigawatts
  of power from teaspoons of fuel\, magnetic fields multiple times more pow
 erful than MRI machines\, and neutron fluxes strong enough to transmute ma
 tter in bulk.\n\nComing away from this presentation\, the audience will ha
 ve learned about the fundamentals of nuclear fusion and appreciate the key
  issues enough to put the marketing and news reports into context. They mi
 ght even be excited and enthused about what's to come in this quickly grow
 ing technology space.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/471-u

DESCRIPTION:CANCELLED - Unsuitable wind conditions have unfortunately mean
 t this balloon launch isn’t able to take place.\n\n\nWe're going to laun
 ch a very large balloon up to the edge of space*.\nAfter a brief introduct
 ion to high altitude ballooning from Dave in the village (plus a safety br
 iefing)\, we'll walk out to an open area of field\, fill a very large ball
 oon with helium\, check the flight computers and let go! The balloon will 
 then drift up to 25km+\, eventually bursting and falling back down to eart
 h.\nAll the while\, we'll be able to track it live on the map\, while even
  hopefully receive some images from the edge of space*.\n\n\nThanks to Dav
 e from the AMSAT-UK / BATC / UKuG village for making this activity possibl
 e.\n\n(* And yes\, we know balloons don't actually go to the edge of space
 \, but it's still going to be a lot higher than even commercial planes fly
 !)\n\n\nThis workshop is (initially) taking place in The Unnamed Village.

 because it is based on Arduino\, and it has a touch keyboard.  It also has
  a built-in speaker/amp\, so you can play/perform wherever you go.\n\nArdu
 Touch comes pre-programmed with a way nice 4-voice sawtooth waveform\, but
  can be easily re-programmed with other way different synths\, including a
 lready available drums\, drones\, noise\, arpegios\, and more\; or with sy
 nths of your own making.\n\nUnder-16s must be accompanied by an adult\, an

 aper. This workshop will require some dexterity and patience - if you have
  less dexterity then you will require more patience but we'll get there to
 gether!\n\nOpen to younger ages\, but recommended 12+ to get the most out 
 of the workshop. Under-16s must be accompanied by an adult\, and both must

 un\, supportive workshop that will give you the confidence to get started 
 in this exciting area. You can expect plenty of exercises\, as well as ins
 piring talks from those who were once in your shoes. You’ll cover the ba
 sics of programming in Python\, as well as useful libraries and tools such
  as Jupyter notebooks\, pandas\, and Matplotlib.\n\nIn this hands-on works
 hop\, you’ll work through a series of beginner-friendly materials at you
 r own pace. You’ll work within small groups\, each with an assigned ment
 or\, who will be there to help you with any questions or whenever you get 
 stuck. All you’ll need to bring is a laptop that can connect to the inte

DESCRIPTION:When we’re out and about\, text messages (and also voice cal
 ls\, mobile data etc.) sent and received through our everyday smartphones 
 are all routed through fixed land-based ‘cell tower’ antennas no more 
 than a few km distant\, which form what we might term a ‘Terrestrial Net
 work’ (TN). In rural areas\, we often lose cellular wireless signal enti
 rely\, even within highly technologically advanced economies such as the U
 K\, EU\, US etc. We then find that we are unable to send or receive text m
 essages\, even emergency messages. \n\nIn the 1990s\, visionary scientists
  and engineers developed alternative voice and messaging systems\, using s
 atellites as their ‘flying’ cell towers. We will discuss an example of
  such a pioneering network\, called Iridium\, which has operated successfu
 lly from the late 1990s right up to the present day. Today’s scientist a
 nd engineer visionaries are now proposing that the same ‘space-based’ 
 capabilities could be added to our everyday smartphones\, without needing 
 to purchase a separate satellite-messaging device. This would allow our ph
 one\, when necessary\, to switch from the land-based TN to the space-based
  ‘Non-Terrestrial Network’ (NTN). In this presentation we will discuss
  some of the technical challenges in achieving this ‘Direct-to-Device’
  (D2D) satellite messaging feature\, and some of the solutions which are b
 eing proposed\, and even already being tested for real. One of the leading
  players in this space is Starlink\, so buckle up for a wild ride!\n\nLink

 risks are.\n\nThe presenter recently left a long career in the US oil indu

 to produce it look like on the ground? What equipment is used? What are th

DESCRIPTION:It sounds easy enough: build a clock that always shows the cor
 rect local time\, no matter where you take it. Mobile phones can sort-of d
 o this\, but they manage by listening to the cell towers\, so this won't w
 ork everywhere. "Radio controlled" clocks just listen to a low frequency b
 roadcast\, there's a few different transmissions across the world but they
 're incompatible and know nothing of time zones. Desktop computers can use
  the internet for time\, but you still have to tell it what zone you're in
 .\n\nReally\, it should be possible to build a clock with nothing more tha
 n a GPS receiver\, which figures out the time on its own\, with no need fo
 r internet or cellular connection. It turns out that doing this requires a
 n on-board world atlas\, a spherical coordinate point-in-polygon algorithm
 \, and a complete database of offsets and daylight savings rules.\n\nI fin
 ally created a clock that automatically corrects itself as you carry it ac
 ross country and timezone borders. The journey to this point was so ridicu
 lously tedious that it borders on the absurd. In this talk I'll run throug
 h some of the highlights\, and of course no talk about GPS time would be c
 omplete without mentioning leap seconds\, which cause problems even when t
 hey don't happen.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/337-gps-t

DESCRIPTION:As a semi-professional plane spotter when I hear or see an air
 craft fly over I will sometimes point at it. But I can't always tell if th
 ere's an aircraft flying over\, and I can't be awake 24/7 so I miss some\,
  which I find unacceptable. \n\nEnter the auto spotter\, a robot that is c
 apable of pointing at the nearest aircraft continuously.\n\nThe auto spott
 er uses 1090Mhz ADS-B Out transmissions to work out where the nearest airc
 raft is relative to its location and works out the bearing and elevation f
 or a pointer. This is the same public data that is used to feed flight inf
 ormation services and can be received by anyone with the right (relatively
  cheap) equipment\; all commercial and many general aviation aircraft arou
 nd the world use it to transmit their positions\, speeds\, altitudes and m
 ore.\nYou may have seen the pointer at EMF2022 (in between rain showers) a
 nd this talk goes into some of the details of how it was developed\, and h
 ow it works.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/45-the-auto-pl

DESCRIPTION:Join the author in a short read-aloud from the STEM fantasy qu
 est\, Hex Allen and the Clanksmiths and learn how Hex uses her engineering
  skills to outsmart monsters using everything from LEDs to electromagnets 
 to water balloon launchers.\n\nBook summary:\nHex Allen can't do magic - a
  huge problem when everything from lights to locks is powered by simple sp
 ells that everyone (save a few unfortunate "Undevelopeds") can do. After y
 ears of feeling useless\, Hex seizes the chance to change her future by jo
 urneying to the Wishing Wyrm\, a legendary dragon that will grant a single
  wish once a century. Unfortunately\, Hex isn't the only one after the wis
 h\, and every rival wish hunter has magic on their side. Every rival excep
 t the Clanksmiths\, Cam and Fuse. Like Hex\, they can't do magic\, but the
 y've learned to build clank\, creations made using the mysterious\, forgot
 ten arts of science and engineering.\n\nAfter a fairy fiasco throws Hex an
 d the Clanksmiths together\, they agree to cooperate - for the time being.
  With the Clanksmiths' know-how and Hex's creativity\, they outsmart monst
 ers with everything from LEDs to electromagnets to water balloon launchers
 . But as they race to the Wishing Wyrm\, Hex must decide between her frien
 dship with the Clanksmiths and the wish that would give her a normal\, mag
 ical life.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable age range: All

DESCRIPTION:Single Sign-On (SSO) is sold as a way to\n•	centralize manag
 ing your organization’s users\,\n•	make life easier for your colleague
 s\, and\n•	enforce consistent security standards.\nBut SSO protocols are
  just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenti
 cated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor “
 yeah\, that’s Bob” doesn’t tell me what the vendor does with this in
 formation\, or if the vendor always asks me who’s coming in the door.\nA
  bad SSO implementation can make you think you’re safer\, while hiding a
 ll the new and fun things that have gone wrong.\nTo get the most out of im
 plementing SSO\, I need to know what I’m trying to accomplish and what s
 teps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set 
 up carefully\, for each of the things you need to do right\, I’ll give y
 ou some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wron
 g. We all learn from failure\, right???\nI’m sharing this info because t
 his year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at wor
 k. It turns out that I’m good at asking weird questions\, and it’s an 
 extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be\, then yo
 u know where they could be broken\, and you can ask your vendors (and your
  colleagues!) “weird questions” before an adversary does.\n\n\nLink: h

 convert sound to light using reflected and refracted lasers. The idea was 
 to create a synesthesia between light and sound.\n\nNow with over 700 lase
 rs it is arranged as three self contained units that project onto a white 
 surface 5 to 10 meters away. It requires as much darkness as possible and 
 takes 2/3 hours to set up. The lasers and the motors that turn them (or th
 e object in front of them) are all controlled via midi making it a sort of
  light organ that creates something nobody has seen before.\n\nhttps://fun

DESCRIPTION:Gas boilers\, almost all homes in the UK have them\, but they 
 are dreadful!\n+90% of the ones I've seen are badly spec'ed and horribly c
 onfigured\, so they burn way too much gas.\nThen Martin Lewis keeps tellin
 g us to "lower the flow temperature" but it's never really explained how t
 o\, or what this does to save gas (and money). \n\nWell have I got a Slide
  Deck for you!!\n\nAs with any serious problem\, it needs hard data. So I 
 wired my Raspberry Pi home server to my central heating controls\, wrote a
  bunch of code\, and spent last winter collecting data from my boiler\, a 
 dozen temperature sensors\, some humidity sensors and the Octopus Energy A
 PI.\n\nI have pretty graphs to show what happens all around my home\, how 
 altering the flow temperature works\, how altering set points work\, why m
 y house was too cold\, then too hot\, and used way too much gas. \nI'll ex
 plain the (simple) physics and how to tweak your system for best performan
 ce too. \n\nBut ultimately\, we all have to stop burning gas and move to h
 eat pumps\, a solution not understood by many and requiring something of a
  mind shift from the way gas central heating has always worked. I'll expla
 in how heat pumps work and what you can do to prepare for their arrival in
  your home.\n\nThe future is bright\, and it's heading rapidly in this dir

DESCRIPTION:Technologists are wizards. Today\, we wield the power to effec
 t changes from a tent\, a bedroom or an office the likes of which fifty ye
 ars ago one might need the power of a small nation-state to accomplish.\n\
 nHaving seen these systems from all angles - building the tech\, researchi
 ng digital consent academically\, and fighting biased public sector algori
 thms in the media and the courts - I'm confident that we really haven’t 
 adapted to that reality. In the choices we make in technical practice\, we
  find ourselves paving the road to hell with our good intentions.\n\nMost 
 of us aren't trained in ethics\, policy or politics - so how do we manage 
 the weighty burden of being responsible for people’s safety? What can we
  do – both as individuals and as a society as a whole – to try and sto
 p algorithmic harms? And\, how do we stop our robots from killing us?\n\nL

DESCRIPTION:Earlier this year\, a developer was trying to benchmark a data
 base. But something was wrong - SSH was taking up too much CPU time in the
  background. This accidental observation led to the discovery of an audaci
 ous attempt to introduce a backdoor that would allow an attacker access to
  almost any system in the world running SSH\, an attack made up of both te
 chnical and social components.\n\nThis talk will describe the backdoor its
 elf\, the process that went into it being possible to inject in the first 
 place\, and how this was exacerbated by a series of entirely reasonable de
 cisions on the part of Linux distributions. It's a story of social enginee
 ring\, novel obfuscation mechanisms\, and a long con over several years. W
 e'll delve into why distributions patch upstream code\, why dependency cha
 ins are complicated\, and how it's even possible for a compression library
  to break all the SSH security mechanisms that are intended to prevent thi
 s sort of thing from happening in the first place.\n\nLink: https://www.em

  my guide canes — and sense the world like I do: using air currents\, he
 at\, sound\, echolocation\, ground texture\, wind shadow\, and more. It's 
 a unique\, permanent sensory upgrade you can still use when sighted.\n\nDe
 tails of what to expect: https://s.ai/emf#workshop\n\nStarting location is
  between the cluster of 4 trees south of the lounge: https://map.emfcamp.o

 nce schedule are not real — they're only a placeholder. I expect to do 1
  a day\, Thursday through Sunday. I'll email you as soon as I'm able (whic
 h might be day-of)\, to tell you when to come after I decide actual times 
 — based on responses to the sign-up form\, group coordination\, my own s
 chedule & spoons\, brightness\, & weather. I am not likely to be able to d
 o more than 1/day other than for special circumstances\, nor before twilig
 ht\, but that's TBD.\n\n## Mandatory:\n* Sign up using the form at https:/
 /s.ai/emf/ws\n* Be completely sober.\n* Have at least 1.5 hours free (pref
 erably 2).\n* Watch my CCC talk about this: https://s.ai/ccc You'll learn 
 much more if we can focus on what I can't show in the talk.\n\n## Very str
 ongly encouraged: \n* Bring a friend or prior participant to act as your a
 ssistant\, and sign up as one to pass it on to others. The two experiences
  are very different\, and are both valuable — and I can't teach as many 
 people simultaneously without help.\n* Pee\, drink\, and wash your hands b
 eforehand.\n* Wear clothing that leaves head and arms uncovered\, and thin
  shoes that let you feel the ground.\n* Give feedback afterwards at https:
 //s.ai/emf/fb\n* Use a group coordination code on the sign-up form to get 
 scheduled with your friends etc.\n\n## Special:\nI may run additional besp
 oke workshops\, at different times\, if you:\n1. have visual impairment th
 at may benefit from cane use\, whether or not you've had O&M\;\n2. have ot
 her disabilities that would benefit from doing this 1-on-1 (e.g. Deaf or w
 heelchair user)\;\n3. work professionally with cane users or in very low v
 isibility environments\;\n4. are part of EMF staff\, volunteers\, etc.\;\n
 5. can video record the workshop (e.g. stabilised GoPro)\, or participate 
 on camera\; or\n6. have some other good reason for me to do an extra sessi
 on or in a bespoke manner.\n\nIf any of that applies to you\, please indic
 ate it on the sign-up form\, and include all times that could work for you
  — including day 0 (Thursday).\n\n## Weather\n\nIf it's raining\, or the
  ground is still muddy from recent rain\, the workshop will be cancelled. 
 \n\nThere's one exception: if you have visual impairment\, it's still on. 
 (You need to know how to get around no matter what the weather is.)\n\nAtt
 ending this workshop will cost: Before & after online surveys so I can ass
 ess the effects. No monetary payment required (though donations welcome).\
 nSuitable age range: 16+\nAttendees should bring: Bring your own full cove
 rage sleep mask / blindfold if you can. I'll have ones you can use\, but I
  can't resanitise them during camp.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/sched

DESCRIPTION:This workshop is an absolute beginner’s guide to leatherwork
 \, covering the things that I wish I had known when I was first starting. 
 I intend for this workshop to be useful to people who have never worked wi
 th leather before and would like to learn the skills needed to start makin
 g or repairing leather goods.\n\nI will discuss the three main types of le
 ather and which to choose\; the basic tools you will need to start making 
 leather goods (and how to use them)\; how to dye leather\; how to attach e
 yelets\, rivets\, and buckles\; and the three main types of stitch.\n\nFor
  the practical part of the workshop\, you will be sewing a leather keyring
  using one of the most common types of stitch. Saddle Stitch uses one piec
 e of thread with a needle at each end to create a stitch line that is both
  beautiful and resilient. The leather\, thread\, and tools needed to creat
 e your keyring will all be provided.\n\nUnder-16s must be accompanied by a

DESCRIPTION:Make a paper robot that waves its arms with laughter when you 
 tickle its feet\, and learn a bit about physical computing in the process!
  \n\nDuring the workshop you'll...\n-Cut and fold the parts for the robot 
 from paper\n-Connect the servo that drives the robot's arms to the BBC mic
 ro:bit\n-Program the micro:bit using block code\n-Decorate your robot to g
 ive it a personality\n\nWhether you're completely new to robotics or an ex
 pert\, this is a chance to have some fun blending art with engineering\, a
 nd to be inspired by how household materials like paper can be combined wi
 th simple electronics to build fully functional robots. \n\nYou can either
  borrow a micro:bit for the duration of the workshop or bring your own. \n
 Note that if you borrow a micro:bit\, you'll be able to keep your robot bu
 t you'll need to supply your own micro:bit at home to get it back up and r
 unning. \n\nExample of the robot in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?

 basic macrame knots\, and put your newfound knowledge to the test by craft
 ing your very own masterpiece to take home! \nThe history of knot-tying tr
 aces back to ancient times\, with intricate knotting techniques spreading 
 from the Middle East to Spain\, Italy\, and France. Sailors\, especially\,
  embraced macramé for practical purposes during their lengthy sea journey
 s. The Victorian era witnessed a revival of interest in England\, and thro
 ughout the 20th century\, macramé maintained its popularity with artists 
 and crafters exploring innovative designs and materials. Nowadays the craf
 t has evolved beyond its traditional forms and utilitarian purposes\, with
  contemporary artists pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with 
 knotting techniques.\n\nNo prior experience is needed—just bring your en
 thusiasm\, curiosity\, and creative spirit. Children under 10 are welcome 
 with parental supervision.\n\nI'll provide cord and easy-to-follow instruc

DESCRIPTION:How do you transmit data when there’s 205\,000 people trying
  to access the same mobile network in a field? Satellites\, of course! Aft
 er facing dilemmas of tracking the staff shuttles at a major UK festival\,
  we decided to look at other options and discovered some cheap Iridium sat
 ellite constellation hardware on eBay. When they arrived\, we surveyed wha
 t we had purchased\, discovered it was ex-Ministry of Defense hardware\, a
 nd hasn’t been scrubbed properly. After getting a new pair of trousers a
 nd making the relevant disclosures\, we worked to reverse engineer the har
 dware and get some usable data transmitting into space (and back down).\n\
 nThis involved dumping the firmware of the chip\, and stepping bit-by-bit 
 through the memory to understand what was happening\, as well as a few cas
 ual emails to defence contractors. Getting airtime for satellite hardware 
 was also a challenge\, and working around the intricacies of Iridium Short
  Burst Data. Furthermore\, we’ve developed the concept into an interacti
 ve map that overlays the realtime position of the tracker\, and gives spee
 d and heading data.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/90-adve

SUMMARY:The problem with medical influencers

DESCRIPTION:High carb? High fat? Which fat?\nWeights\, are you crazy? It's
  all about cardio!\nCardio\, are you mad? Weights!\nIs Diet Coke giving yo
 u cancer? Did seed oils cause your gammy knee? Fruits are bad now? Ground 
 yourself\, but air your perineum. Suncream is a conspiracy and your brain 
 is infected with mould. Listen to your bowels\, the microbiome is in contr
 ol. Meditate\, but don't enjoy it. Stare directly into the sun. Ice baths!
  Saunas! Ice baths in saunas! (admittedly quite brief)\n\nAnd whatever you
  do\, DON'T. EAT. ANYTHING.\n\nWhy is it so hard to find useful and unders
 tandable medical information on the internet? Why are the people who we go
  to so bad at doing it? Why has wellness become a sickness? NHS consultant
  cardiologist Dr Rohin Francis dives into the wild world of medical influe
 ncers to find out why too much information can be bad for your health.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Take a quick detour into sunny Brighton and sample the city’
 s best-kept secret!*\n\nTuaca\, the Italian spiced brandy-vanilla liqueur\
 , first reached British shores in the 1960s. Everyone in Brighton will tel
 l you a different story about how it got here\, and why you’ll only ever
  find it on the south coast. Was it really first produced for Lorenzo the 
 Magnificent? Did the salesman who brought it to the UK really just enjoy B
 righton so much that he stayed? Is Brighton really responsible for 90% of 
 all Tuaca sales?\n\nThe answers to all these questions and more lie at the
  bottom of a sticky\, cinnamon-sweet shot glass. Come and enjoy a taste of
  Brighton culture!**\n\n*Warning: May contain seagulls.\n\n**Brighton Cons
 ulate cannot take any responsibility for any emotional changes or unusual 
 events you may experience pertaining to seagulls as a result of this tasti

 en look at creating a logo or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (o
 ne colour designs only). There is a cost of £5 per item to cover supplies
 \, but it could be a fun way to bring new life into something you already 
 have. Mugs and tumblers will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I h
 ave. I have a variety of colours\, including foil designs to customise wit
 h. Please bring supplies with you for this\, I will not have anything extr
 a. For T-shirts\, any cotton shirt will do\; I usually pick mine up from T
 esco or Sainsbury’s\, where they have many options in different colours.
 \n\nIf you’re interested in designing something new\, I will have a smal
 l variety of blanks available for customisation and purchase while stocks 
 last.\n- 12 oz coffee mugs (£12) - You can use sublimation / infusible in
 k papers with pre-printed designs suitable for cutting out\, or I have som
 e infusible ink pens for drawn designs that would work great with these mu
 gs\n- Accessory bags (large: £20\; and small: £18): I can customise thes
 e bags using Heat Transfer vinyl\, which is great for monograms or simple 
 designs. I have access to a design library if you need ideas for what to i
 nclude with your bag designs. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags w
 ith a navy blue base and natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in blac
 k\, natural\, navy\, or pink. I have a couple of pre-made options availabl
 e too.\n- 20 oz skinny tumblers (£30) - Using sublimation / infusible ink
  papers with pre-printed designs\, these are great for cut-out designs\n- 
 Sublimation t-shirts (£24) (Small—large sizes\; I have some XL\, but I 
 think they run small\, so please check with me on sizes)—These are subli
 mation t-shirt blanks and would work with the infusible ink transfer sheet
 s and infusible ink pens. Also\, if you’re curious why you can do sublim
 ation on some shirts but not on others\, come by and chat with me about th
 e different materials.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable ag
 e range: Aimed at adults\, but supervised kids welcome.\nAttendees should 
 bring: If you want something customised you will need to bring your own bl
 anks. Cotton t-shirts\, mugs\, and water bottles are all good options but 
 get in touch if you have something else in mind to see if I have supplies 
 that will work.\n\nI can work with your own logos or designs. The best typ
 es are simple\, single-colour SVGs for cut-out designs. Drawn designs will
  only work with line art in vector format. Filled designs are possible but
  require more preparation in design software before they can be usable wit
 h any of my pens. Feel free to bring your laptop if there's something you'
 d like to create. I also have access to pre-made designs that we can look 
 through if you have something in mind but don't want to design it yourself

DTEND;TZID=Europe/London;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20240531T200000
UID:2024-668
DESCRIPTION:The Most Sacred Friday Nite Rites shall be undertaken. As told
  by the prophet DJ Bad Boy\, we drink a bottle of Bucky and get out wur ch
 icken.\n\nThis blessed wine\, produced by Benedictine Monks in Devon\, blo
 ody England\, is carefully\, lovingly barrel aged to a smooth\, steady 15%
  alcohol and is imbued in a holy ceremony with a blessed 280mg of caffeine
 . Safe passage across the Border has been assured by the Buckfast Accord o
 f 1669 for even the bloody English appreciate that to starve Scotland of i
 ts key religious artifact will result in an invasive war and oppressive oc
 cupation. This is the source of the common phrase "Buckfast gets you fucke
 d fast" - the leading word "Nae" was dropped due to a misunderstanding of 
 intent during the Victorian era\, and now the phrase is a common celebrati
 on and acknowledgement of the intensity of the Rites.\n\nWhen consumed in 
 the appropriate manner (directly from the bottle\, completed in roughly 1 
 hour) it will aid you in seeing through time and being particularly of the
  moment. Often\, first time participants of the Drinkers Rites will find u
 pon completion of their experience that they have voluntarily shed themsel
 ves of all material possessions. This is to be expected - when you are acc
 elerated to the Blessed Plane of Existence\, the whisperings of ancient go
 ds and creatures that exist between dimensions will often assist the reali
 sation that material possessions are temporary\, but Tonic Experiences are
  for life.\n\nA note of caution to all prospective disciples\, however - t
 he intensity of your experience may transfer all the joy contained in your
  soul to be used tomorrow and expend it during the ritual. This transfer o
 ften leads to a despondent day\, where one reflects only upon the negative
  aspects of life. Do not fret\, to experience the highest of highs we must
  understand that with which it contrasts. The despair of the day after\, c
 oupled with the infamous Jakey Shakes and occasional rejections of all foo
 d and liquid are only temporary.\n\nThis is part of the journey as set out
  by The Wine\, produced by the most blessed monks of Devonshire. It teache
 s us that while all shall return to equilibrium\, to break from normality 
 for just a moment of time may bring incredible joy.\n\nWhy don't you join 
 Scots of all shapes and sizes at the nearest consular outpost on Friday to
  experience the Friday Nite Rites. It must be noted\, the numbers stamped 
 on the base of the bottle are a measure of ritual experience\, and acolyte
 s may start you on a high number (indicating low intensity)\, restricting 
 the blessed Number 1 bottle for only the most revered members of the encam
 pment.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/668-friday-nite-ri

DESCRIPTION:In a world where large language models like GPT and Gemini are
  becoming more and more ubiquitous\, what does this mean for comedy? If co
 mputers getting things obviously wrong is a factor in their comedy value\,
  do the improvements in generative AI take us into an uncanny valley where
  the outputs are realistic enough to no longer be funny? \n\nJoin our pres
 enters as they each argue the case for one side of the battle between gene
 rations from large language models\, vs. more naive generation approaches.
  \n\nWe’ll explore what makes comedy funny at all\, and then drill deepe
 r into why we find content generated by computers so hilarious - often whe
 n it’s not trying to be! \n\nThroughout the talk we’ll give some examp
 les of humorous computer generated content from past projects - intentiona
 l or otherwise. Learn why you shouldn’t join us for dinner when the reci
 pes are auto-generated\; see how we abuse state-of-the-art AI safety techn
 iques to make LLMs funnier\; and join for a group singalong for some live-
 generated parody karaoke. \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/

 eed to know about electronics\, Learn to solder (everyone can learn!)\, ma
 ke an Arduino clone from a kit\, how to set up the free and open-source Ar
 duino software (Windows\, Linux\, and MacOS are all fine!)\, How to progra
 m Arduinos\, how to read schematic diagrams\, Put together your own TV-B-G
 one remote control using your Arduino clone board using a solderless bread
 board. Target practice is available all over the world after the workshop.

DESCRIPTION:Over the past five decades\, the concert & live event industry
  has undergone a dramatic transformation into a major sector of the econom
 y\, with the production playing a pivotal role. Artists and their shows co
 nstantly seek the latest lighting & video technology\, intricate stage set
 ups\, and top-notch audio quality to dazzle fans. Ticket sales are a major
  revenue stream for Artists\, and a high-quality production show\, sells t
 ickets.\n\nThis high level of production is only possible because of an in
 dustry full of talented roadies. Behind every arena or stadium show lies a
  hundreads of engineers tirelessly setting up\, operating\, and dismantlin
 g these elaborate stage setups\, often in a new venue\, on a daily basis. 
 Long gone are the days of makeshift equipment cobbled together\, roadies n
 ow navigate highly sophisticated AV control systems supported by intricate
  network infrastructures.\n\nA vast array of specialised hardware caters s
 pecifically to live events\, engineered to be both flexible for on-the-fly
  adjustments and durable for daily setup and teardown. Reliability is para
 mount\, with equipment expected to perform flawlessly show after show\, ne
 ver missing a beat. \n\nIn this talk we are going to take an overview into
  the world of live event production\, shedding light on how roadies consis
 tently deliver stellar performances day in and day out. We'll explore the 
 intricacies of AV networks\, offering an insightful overview of the behind
 -the-scenes magic that brings unforgettable concerts to life.\n\n\nLink: h

DESCRIPTION:A research project that started with the question\, 'what was 
 the average person in Britain eating 500 years ago?'\, and resulted in a r
 ich knowledge base of over 1200 native and naturalised plants with food us
 es. The vast majority of our modern foods originate overseas\, introduced 
 to Britain by colonialism and Victorian exploration\, and the global human
  diet now contains less than 100 plants\, with limited biodiversity.\n\nSt
 arting from the BSBI's database of native and naturalised plants\, over th
 e course of 3+ years I painstakingly reseached each entry for historic\, a
 rchaeological\, or ethnographically documented food uses. This body of anc
 estral knowledge could help provide local food resilience\, reduce the imp
 act of the plants we eat\, and better protect food supplies from climate c
 hange\, pollinator loss and disease. \n\nThe research is still in its raw 
 form as a giant spreadsheet\, so the first part of the talk will focus on 
 the process of research and identification\, and some of the trickier ques
 tions such as the difference between a food and a medicine\, what level of
  toxicity is tolerable\, and how to really define a native plant. The seco
 nd part will focus on some highlights of the results\, including obscure d
 isused vegetables\, native things you can still forage\, lost recipes for 
 brewed alcohols and psychoactives\, vegetables we've bioengineered for edi
 bility\, some exciting natural poisions\, and addressing whether or not le
 ttuce really exists.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/461-th

 a fantastic dancer!\n\nFunding helped us build a troupe of 4 Crawlybots th
 at we have taken to many public engagement events\, and allowed hundreds o
 f kids to take control of the Crawlybots via remote control and FPV drone 
 goggles. The bots bring joy wherever they go\, across all ages\, even amon

 tire of the privatisation of British Rail.\n\nToday\, the railway system i
 s now part public part private\, leaving plenty of confusion for passenger
 s.\n\nWho runs your local station? Who sets the rail fares\, and who cover
 s your refund? And where the hell does HS1 and HS2 fit into all this? I wi
 ll take you through how the UK rail organisations are structured\, who doe
 s and owns what\, and how does this affect passengers?\n\n- What's the dif
 ference between Network Rail and National Rail? \n- How does split ticketi
 ng work? \n- What did Labour announce in April?\n\nAnd most importantly: \
 nWho should I be angry at when I'm crammed in sideways on a delayed Sunday
  afternoon train to Leeds?\n\nNo knowledge of the rail industry is require

  your ALDI shop.\nDuring our presentation\, we invite the audience to delv
 e into the fascinating world of motorising random objects and the art of u
 pcycling\, along with the myriad challenges we encountered along the way. 
 From designing our own lithium-polymer batteries to countless iterations a
 nd rigorous testing\, we'll discuss the intricacies of dealing with electr
 omagnetic interference\, experimenting with various motor controllers\, an
 d even designing our own from scratch. We want people to experience the sh
 enanigans we went through and the fun we had along the way to hopefully ge
 t more people into whacky-wheeled…..wehicles.\nBut it's not all talk! We
 're excited to demonstrate the trolley live\, allowing you to experience f
 irst-hand the joy and sheer mayhem it brings. Our goal is to inspire you t
 o embark on your own wacky-wheeled adventures\, learning from our missteps
  and benefiting from our advice and tips.\nNo Project is ever truly done l
 astly we want to look into the future: The intended use cases and how we a
 im to share our knowledge and plans with the wider community. Our commitme
 nt to openness and collaboration means that anyone bold enough to motorise
  anything around them can benefit from our experiences and insights.\n\nLi

 nd its effects on the human body. It charts our changing relationship with
  it from the 18th century to today. I particularly love the 18th century g
 entlemen scientists with their electrical entertainments - particularly be
 cause they appreciated the magic of electriocity and were so excited by it
 . Its sad that people today just take electricity for granted. Over the ye
 ars I've accumulated a collection of contemporary images which I'll use to
  illustrate the talk. It may include a few demonstations as well. \n\nLink

DESCRIPTION:It's 1975! You need a high-resolution computer display for fin
 e drawings (e.g. CAD diagrams). Memory's EXPENSIVE\, processors are slow: 
 what to do? Here's an analog solution to a digital problem: an unusual cat
 hode-ray tube that preserves whatever it draws with no flickering\, fading
 \, or any kind of refresh. A brilliant dot sears emerald trails into the s
 creen\, rendering intricate line-art without pixels. No need for video mem
 ory when the screen itself remembers!\n\nIt's mesmerising to see this spec
 ial tube in action\; more satisfying still to know how it works. Discover 
 a mechanism Tektronix refined over three decades\, growing from palm-sized
  oscilloscope readouts to 25" computer-lab behemoths. A wreath of electron
  guns\, kilovolt potentials\, microscopic cobalt cones\, and transparent a
 nodes set the stage for a nonlinear dance of charges that yields visualisa
 tions with style --- and we'll unravel its mysteries with animated diagram
 s. En route we'll visit notable storage tube applications\, from early com
 puter memories to 1978's _Battlestar Galactica_. Of course we'll see a rea
 l Tektronix terminal at work\, too!\n\nComputer memory is cheap now: by th
 e mid 1980s\, modern displays had advantages storage-tube systems couldn't
  overcome. Nobody's making them anymore\, so check out this talk while old
  stock still works!\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/43-forg

DESCRIPTION:Caves present a challenging environment to survey and map. Con
 ditions are often wet\, muddy and involve confined spaces. This talk will 
 look at how the technology we have developed has changed how we measure an
 d create maps of cave systems. From traditional sighting compasses\, tape 
 measures and paper and pencil\, to laser measures\, bluetooth data transfe
 r and PDAs or mobile phones as recording and drawing devices. Then once th
 e data is collected underground\, how open source software has been develo
 ped by cavers to process the data and draw maps which adjust to later chan
 ges in positions of parts of the cave when more data is collected or corre
 cted. We'll look at loop closures\, explorations of places no person has g
 one before\, and different ways to present a 3 dimensional map of a 70km c
 ave system. There will be plenty of photographs and video clips of cave ex
 ploration\, along with live software demos and viewing of digital maps.\n\

DESCRIPTION:This talk will take a look at Älgen\, a custom-built guitar t
 hat is a fusion of traditional hand-crafted woodwork and advanced 3D-print

 an 4 different types of 3D-printing\, including 3D-printed aluminium. At t
 he same time it sticks with traditional hand built woodwork for the playin
 g surface\, matching material with function.\n\nThis talk will focus on th
 e design behind the guitar\, looking at what you can do with generative de
 sign and 3D-printing\, how to interface the old and new construction techn
 iques (e.g.\, mating a walnut body with 3D-printed nylon sides)\, and how 
 to decide what bits to do with which technique. \n\nI'll also show how I a
 chieved this as an amateur maker: the aim is to show the audience that wha
 t seems like far-out construction is actually reachable by us mortals than

DESCRIPTION:Emily Peasgood and Mark Hanslip will present a talk on creatin
 g EverSong\, followed by an invitation to try their vocal transfer models 
 in real-time. \n\nEverSong is a sound installation where you can hear the 
 lifespan of a person in a song\, from 5-years-old at the start to 95-years
 -old at the end. It explores the fragility of life\, its circularity\, inv
 ites people to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our 
 legacy as humans moving into an increasingly digital age. \n\nSince Januar
 y 2024\, Peasgood & Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC\, a newly-developed 
 process which builds on Google Magenta’s DDSP by combining it with a dif
 fusion-based vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 a
 nd trained models which can be mapped onto Emily’s voice enabling her to
  sound younger and older than she is. \n\nThis technology is starting to b
 e adopted by contemporary pop musicians\, high-profile examples being web 
 services such as Grimes’ Elf and Holly Herndon’s Holly+. \n\nEverSong 
 represents a new application of this technology by making it possible to h
 ear a voice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathwa
 ys\, installed sustainably in nature\, touring before finding a permanent 
 home in an ancient site.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/12

DESCRIPTION:I recently released Downpour\, an app that anyone can use to m
 ake little games on their phone. And before that I made Cheap Bots\, Done 
 Quick\, a website that anyone could use to make a Twitterbot on their comp

  I love the feeling of seeing other people make cool stuff\, and knowing t
 hat I enabled that to happen. In this talk\, I'm going to talk about some 
 design principles I've gathered from making these kinds of things\, share 
 some stories of people using them in ways I didn't expect\, and generally 
 try to persuade you that it's an interesting space that you might want to

DESCRIPTION:If you are a British nerd of a certain age\, you almost certai
 nly played Elite on the BBC Micro. And if you didn't\, this talk will expl
 ain why you should care about a now 40-year-old game.\n\nIt was years ahea
 d of its time\, with 3D graphics\, a procedurally generated open world\, a
 nd a whole novel's worth of lore - all running on an 8-bit home microcompu
 ter in 1984\, when most games were little more advanced than Pac-Man or Sp
 ace Invaders.\n\nOver the last few years\, I've been picking apart the ori
 ginal Elite game engine to understand how it worked\, and also to experime
 nt with extending it.\n\nIn this talk\, I'll examine some of the methods t
 hat the game used - how it used the graphics hardware\, how the game state
  is represented in memory\, how the ship models were designed\, how the AI
  worked\, and how galaxies and planets were generated. I'll also explain s
 ome quirks of the game... including the real reason that docking was so ha
 rd.\n\nI'll demonstrate some new tools I've developed\, which access the g
 ame state in real time\, letting you experience the original game in new w
 ays - including an OpenGL frontend with VR support\, and an attempt to rec
 reate an arcade-style version of the game\, with an old-school vector disp
 lay.\n\nFinally\, if all goes to plan\, I will attempt to demonstrate some
 thing that was an impossible dream for 40 years: multiplayer Elite on the 
 original BBC Micro version.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024

DESCRIPTION:During the pandemic\, trains got weird for a while. We weren
 ’t quite sure whether it was safe to travel collectively\, and the impac
 ts of that difficult time continue to shape our railway network to this da
 y. \n\nMeanwhile\, many of us were exploring our own\, hyperlocal neighbou
 rhoods on foot with obsessive levels of depth that we never otherwise woul
 d have got around to. (Was I the only one who highlighted every street I w
 alked in a London A-Z to see if I could get complete coverage?!)\n\nIn 202
 1\, I did a design-based MA all about railways\, railway infrastructure\, 
 and what it means to travel and live communally. To do this\, I walked all
  the way from London to Brighton (in sections)\, following the railway lin
 e as closely as possible. This is a talk about what I saw and what I thoug
 ht about\, and will hopefully be enjoyed by fans of trains\, hiking\, comm
 unity and travel. (And anyone else who fancies a sit down\, I’ll try and
  make it interesting\, I promise)\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedul

 mpact of placing large turbines on the seabed is not fully understood. In 
 particular\, how are sea mammals coping with such changes in their environ

 ible? For over a year\, we have been annotating more than 60 terabytes of 
 data\, finding these rare events of interest. We’ve looked at whether Ar
 tificial Intelligence\, combined with sonar\, can automatically spot and c
 lassify interesting underwater objects. We’ve tried several approaches\,
  some more successful than others\, but there are promising results with m
 ovement detection and segmentation. \n\nThis talk covers our initial findi

DESCRIPTION:Are you secretly a spy and/or passionate about open-source? Ma
 ybe you don't trust a cloud-hosted service with your highly classified inf
 ormation\, or perhaps you like to build things for yourself. In this light
 -hearted talk\, you will learn how to make a real-time on-device GenAI-pow
 ered application that can live transcribe and summarize conversations with
 out internet access\, using open-source components.\n\nOur journey begins 
 with an introduction to open-source LLMs and the latest trends in running 
 GenAI tools on your own hardware. We will build up our application step-by
 -step\, first creating a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeli
 ne\, then an LLM-based conversation summarization layer\, presented within
  a Streamlit frontend\, with conversation summaries sent to a lightweight 
 Django API backend for storage.\n\nHere's why this matters:\n1️⃣ Cloud
 -hosted SaaS tools cannot store highly sensitive information.\n2️⃣ Goo
 d open-source alternatives exist for most GenAI tasks\; the more people wh
 o use them\, the more they will thrive.\n3️⃣ Commercial tools will sol
 ve for common use cases\, but developers can build personalised tools that
  are highly specialised for their own bespoke needs.\n\nThis talk is tailo
 red for Python enthusiasts and requires no ML expertise. By seeing a pract
 ical demo come together piece by piece\, attendees will gain a deeper unde
 rstanding of how to build their own complex Generative AI applications and
  be pushed to imagine what they could make for themselves using on-device 
 computation in real-world scenarios. Expect plenty of Python code and some
  fun live demos\, with GitHub code provided for attendees to try it at hom
 e.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/183-whispered-secrets\nV

DESCRIPTION:This is a talk about how we combined textiles\, electronics an
 d storytelling to provide a platform for people to share experiences. \nFo
 r this project\, we wanted to explore more the findings of previous resear
 ch around the guilt mothers feel when feeding their babies\, but in a more
  creative way. Coming at the project from 3 very different points of exper
 tise\, we worked with mums to design and make a touch interactive quilt.\n
 We asked mothers of young babies to describe their emotions around feeding
 \, a topic often emotional and controversial\, and send a voice clip along
  with a piece of their baby’s clothing which we stitched together to cre
 ate a special interactive quilt. The quilt is embedded with electronic tou
 ch sensors which activate the clips when the metal buttons of the clothes 
 are touched. By interacting with them you can hear the stories through hea
 dphones. All this results in a very intimate and emotional experience that
  provides a platform for visibility and understanding and we think is a gr
 eat conversation starter to share stories and create community. \nThe talk
  will include a timeline of how we created a digitally augmented quilt\, a
 nd a few thoughts if you want to make one too. It will also include some o
 f our own reflections when working on a project that brings up difficult e
 motions and sensitive topics. \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2

DESCRIPTION:I’m an archivist. Every day I deal with the records that peo
 ple chose to save\, or forgot to destroy. Archival material ranges from th
 e sublime (Royal wills\, lost love letters\, newspapers announcing the Tit
 anic’s demise) to the ridiculous (broken chips of wax from old seals\, I
 OUs from unknown persons\, too much human hair).\n\nA key role of an archi
 vist is to decide what to save and what to destroy. But this is the past. 
 Today most records are no longer on paper but sent in the form of bytes an
 d I’ve started to wonder what the point of my job really is? We have fre
 e access to near-unlimited email inboxes\, all our photos are backed up to
  the cloud to access from anywhere\, and instant messaging is synced betwe
 en our devices. Why bother deciding what to keep for posterity? Just save 
 everything\, let computers do the hard work\, and all will be well. \n\nTh
 is approach unsettled me so much that I set off to explore what it would r
 eally mean if we “saved everything”: how this would affect our world\,
  communities\, and ourselves as humans. In this talk\, I will share this j
 ourney and my thoughts with you\, and try to persuade you that my job is n

DESCRIPTION:Resistance\, systemic change\, and our sustainable future can 
 – and must – be playful! To quote the activism artist group Guerilla G
 irls: “If you can make someone who disagrees with you laugh\, you're in 
 their brain\, and you can change minds.”\n\nThe speaker will begin by sh
 aring her journey in social impact games and its landscape\, focusing on a
 ctivism initiatives in games. She will draw examples primarily from the UN
 ’s Playing for the Planet’s Green Game Jam which includes ustwo games
 ’ Monument Valley 2's The Lost Forest. Surveys from the jam reveal how g
 ames can spur positive actions in real life.\n\nThen we take action -- thr
 ough play. In this RPG-lite / communal storytelling experience curated by 
 the speaker\, a few volunteers will take on special roles to battle a drag
 on turned to the darkside. We’ll meet in our imaginary tavern and advent
 ure together to save the world!\n\nLet’s play and change the world toget
 her.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/411-activism-in-game

DESCRIPTION:Want to hear your voice in the past and future? \n\nCome and t
 ry Peasgood and Hanslip's vocal transfer models in real-time. \n\nThis dem
 o follows from Peasgood and Hanslips talk on creating EverSong (1pm\, Stag
 e C). \n\nEverSong is a sound installation where you can hear the lifespan
  of a person in a song\, from 5-years-old at the start to 95-years-old at 
 the end. It explores the fragility of life\, its circularity\, invites peo
 ple to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our legacy a
 s humans moving into an increasingly digital age. \n\nSince January 2024\,
  Peasgood & Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC\, a newly-developed process 
 which builds on Google Magenta’s DDSP by combining it with a diffusion-b
 ased vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 and train
 ed models which can be mapped onto Emily’s voice enabling her to sound y
 ounger and older than she is. \n\nThis technology is starting to be adopte
 d by contemporary pop musicians\, high-profile examples being web services
  such as Grimes’ Elf and Holly Herndon’s Holly+. \n\nEverSong represen
 ts a new application of this technology by making it possible to hear a vo
 ice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathways\, ins
 talled sustainably in nature\, touring before finding a permanent home in 
 an ancient site.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable age rang

DESCRIPTION:The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a ni
 ce and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short fore
 word and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones w
 hen talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high qua
 lity selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products\, plus we add some
  really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of t
 he tasting are French ciders\, especially from Normandie region and partly
  Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least 
 one sample from North of Spain\, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from 
 England\, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have t
 here one from there and generally we include at least one German Apfelwein
 e\,\n\nThis tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one tur
 ned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that sample
 s and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up i

DESCRIPTION:Let's meet outside the Lounge.\n\nWe'll try to be outside\, we
 ather permitting. If we meet by the entrance to the Lounge - we'll find so
 me outside space.\n\nThankfully crime in a public space is rare. But it’
 s common for an adult or child to be worried\, anxious or even frightened 
 when walking around on their own\, or engaging socially outside their home
 \, especially during winter evenings. For some\, these feelings have been 
 compounded by isolation during lockdown. Although difficult situations sel
 dom arise\, the unexpected can happen.\n\nI offer an interactive workshop\
 , designed for adults and children -  over 10 years old who are beginning 
 to experience greater independence from their parents or guardians. This n
 ewfound freedom comes with some risk\, which can be substantially reduced 
 using some straightforward preparation and techniques.\n\nMy workshop empo
 wers and encourages adults and children to take responsibility for their o
 wn safety\, giving them confidence.\n\nAs a father of three I know the inc
 redible confidence kids experience when they feel able to navigate our wor
 ld - and the reassurance that can give to parents and carers. I’d love t
 o pass my knowledge and advice to you and your children.\n\nI focus on spa
 tial awareness\, avoiding uncomfortable situations and confrontation\, sim
 ple planning\, safe conduct whilst on the street\, and what to do in an em
 ergency situation. Key areas covered:\n\n- Preparing yourself: planning/cl
 othing/valuables/bags\n\n- On the move: street awareness/danger areas/safe

DESCRIPTION:Hebocon is Robot Wars for those who are not technically gifted
 \, or who would like to stop being technically gifted for a few hours.\nTw
 irling assemblages of junk face off against hot glue monstrosities\, whils
 t some contenders might fail to move at all.\n\nThe most successful robots
  are those which are truly ‘heboi’\, meaning technically poor or low i
 n quality. These are bots constructed without the technology or skill that
  you’d usually expect in a robot fighting tournament.\n\nWatch 16 robots
  battle it out and fail joyously!\n\nGet a ticket for the Hebocon Building
  Workshop if you want to compete! Kits and building materials are provided
  there\, and the first round of the competition will be happening there.\n

DESCRIPTION:The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a ni
 ce and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short fore
 word and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones w
 hen talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high qua
 lity selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products\, plus we add some
  really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of t
 he tasting are French ciders\, especially from Normandie region and partly
  Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least 
 one sample from North of Spain\, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from 
 England\, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have t
 here one from there and generally we include at least one German Apfelwein
 e\,\n\nThis tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one tur
 ned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that sample
 s and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up i
 n a decent plus would help covering costs \n\nPlease signup here: https://

DESCRIPTION:I once accidentally got YouGov to poll whether it should be 
 ‘the data is’ or ‘the data are’. \n\nWhether you favour 'are' or '
 is'\, in many ways\, data is plural. When we talk about data\, we’re tal
 king about different things\, contexts\, needs\, and perspectives. Thinkin
 g of ‘data’ as a singular thing brings risks. We always have to set da
 ta in a more plural context and can never think about ‘just’ the data.
  And data we think of as being about us – singular\, as individuals – 
 is often about a plurality of others\, and its value – to governments an
 d tech companies – is in plurality or aggregate. All of this means we ne
 ed to rethink our approach to data and take a relational\, collective and 
 democratic - a plural\, political and human – approach.\n\nLink: https:/

DESCRIPTION:Air pollution is a major public health issue but you’d be su
 rprised how few official monitoring stations there are in Europe. That’s
  an issue because pollution levels can vary a lot even between adjacent st
 reets so to get the best picture possible we need more sensors! This is wh
 ere citizen lead projects like Sensor.Community are doing amazing things.\
 n\nIn this workshop you’ll put together an air quality monitor made from
  an ESP8266 and a few sensors\, load up the firmware and connect it to the
  sensor.community network so that other people\, scientists and policy mak
 ers can see where the problems are and hopefully change something. We’ll
  discuss options for weather proofing\, where to place the sensor and how 
 to hook it into your own smart home setup if you have one. \n\nI will be s
 elling kits at cost which include:\n    - An ESP8266 Dev board with micro 
 USB port\n    - A BME280 Pressure/Temp/Humidity sensor\n    - A 2m micro U
 SB cable\n    - F-F header cables\n    - An SDS011 particulate matter sens
 or\n    - A USB power supply **is not** included\, let's try to prevent so
 me e-waste by reusuing an old one! \n\nI currently have 10 kits including 
 the SDS011 for £40 and an additional 20 with just the BME280 for £15. Yo
 u will need to bring your own usb power supply or plug it into a laptop an
 d I will leave the weather proofing up to you once you install it at home.
 \n\nI can accept payment in cash (exact change only please!)\, contactless
  or bank transfer. I don't have a physical card reader so can't accept chi
 p and pin payments only contactless. \n\nA special shoutout will go to any
 one who:\n- Scrounges together the parts for a sensor purely from things t
 hey get at the camp!\n- Get the firmware running on the EMFcamp badge!\n- 
 Makes an airquality themed Hexpansion for the badge!\n- Does something els

DESCRIPTION:Special event - Talk followed by secret film screening\n\nWhat
  do impact campaigns accomplish in the creative landscape\, and what is th
 e role and responsibility of the media in driving that social impact? Insp
 ired by the film "Don't Look Up"\, where Benn produced the impact campaign
 \, we will explore this dynamic together. When the ethics are no longer fo
 cused on being accurate\, but rather being first\,and being attention grab
 bing\, it becomes difficult for people to discern what is and is not an im
 portant story. So we wonder how some of the most important stories either 
 fall through the ether entirely\, or are seen and dismissed by the apparat
 us of the 24 hour news cycle and 3 second refresh feeds. That's what films
  like Don't Look Up tackle so well.\n\nBenn is a SXSW Grand Jury Prize & U

DESCRIPTION:Going for a job in the space industry may seem like a moonshot

 gan my journey into engineering just six years ago by joining a makerspace
 . Using examples from my own experience - plus some history - I’ll exami
 ne how the skills you can pick up as a maker translate over to the space s
 ector\, how there are plenty of similarities between hobbyist making and p
 rofessional space engineering\, and how Makerspaces teach skills that are 
 actually in great demand in professional engineering!\n\nWhere there isn't
  a direct link from makerspaces into professional work\, I'd like to go br
 iefly into what skills you should look to pick up\, and how to do it\, if 
 want you to go for a space job!\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/

DESCRIPTION:Critical research on digital influence and micro targeting has
  generally focused on privacy violations by commercial marketers and Cambr
 idge Analytica-style political manipulation. But increasingly\, the UK gov
 ernment\, police\, and security services are using these tools for public 
 policy. The targeted advertising and influence platforms give public secto
 r actors complex tools with which to target behaviour change communication
 s - allowing them to tailor nudge messages based on online behaviour\, int
 erests\, and fine-detail location. This is allowing the police to use targ
 eted behaviour change advertising to attempt to prevent crime before it ha
 ppens - but poses serious questions for accountability\, ethics\, and priv
 acy.\n\nDrawing on a dataset of more than 12\,000 government adverts from 
 the Meta Ad Library and in-depth interviews with law enforcement\, we map 
 the landscape of what we call 'influence policing' in the UK\, and discuss
  the ethical and democratic implications of this new mode of policing.\n\n

 hould we pay 16 billion euros to keep some physicists happy with a new toy
 ? What has CERN ever done for us? What happens when you lose control of a 
 beam the size of spaghetti with the energy of a full express train?\n\nThi
 s talk\, delivered by a beam instrumentation engineer at CERN\, will intro
 duce CERN and it's accelerator complex\, and discuss the technology requir
 ed to deliver one petabyte of cutting-edge science per day to over 170 res
 earch facilities in 36 countries. The talk will also cover some of CERN's 
 open source software and hardware contributions to date\, and finally expl

 able to customise something you already have on hand - If you have a blank
  cotton t-shirt and an SVG design file\, we can even look at creating a lo
 go or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (one colour designs only).
  There is a cost of £5 per item to cover supplies\, but it could be a fun
  way to bring new life into something you already have. Mugs and tumblers 
 will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I have. I have a variety of
  colours\, including foil designs to customise with. Please bring supplies
  with you for this\, I will not have anything extra. For T-shirts\, any co
 tton shirt will do\; I usually pick mine up from Tesco or Sainsbury’s\, 
 where they have many options in different colours.\n\nIf you’re interest
 ed in designing something new\, I will have a small variety of blanks avai
 lable for customisation and purchase while stocks last.\n- 12 oz coffee mu
 gs (£12) - You can use sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printe
 d designs suitable for cutting out\, or I have some infusible ink pens for
  drawn designs that would work great with these mugs\n- Accessory bags (la
 rge: £20\; and small: £18): I can customise these bags using Heat Transf
 er vinyl\, which is great for monograms or simple designs. I have access t
 o a design library if you need ideas for what to include with your bag des
 igns. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags with a navy blue base and
  natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in black\, natural\, navy\, or 
 pink. I have a couple of pre-made options available too.\n- 20 oz skinny t
 umblers (£30) - Using sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed
  designs\, these are great for cut-out designs\n- Sublimation t-shirts (£
 24) (Small—large sizes\; I have some XL\, but I think they run small\, s
 o please check with me on sizes)—These are sublimation t-shirt blanks an
 d would work with the infusible ink transfer sheets and infusible ink pens
 . Also\, if you’re curious why you can do sublimation on some shirts but
  not on others\, come by and chat with me about the different materials.\n
 \nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable age range: Aimed at adults

 hing customised you will need to bring your own blanks. Cotton t-shirts\, 
 mugs\, and water bottles are all good options but get in touch if you have
  something else in mind to see if I have supplies that will work.\n\nI can
  work with your own logos or designs. The best types are simple\, single-c
 olour SVGs for cut-out designs. Drawn designs will only work with line art
  in vector format. Filled designs are possible but require more preparatio
 n in design software before they can be usable with any of my pens. Feel f

DESCRIPTION:Build and fly a solid-fuelled model rocket from scratch!\n\nWe
 'll provide paper templates and all required materials\, you cut and tape 
 the rocket together and then decorate it to taste. Once they're all built 
 we'll take the rockets out to the model flying area and launch them from o

 all made from white card and paper there are plenty of options for decorat
 ion or modification. We'll have some helpers on hand to provide guidance.\
 n\nSuitable for young children with supervision. The build involves mostly
  using scissors and tape\, one step involves hot glue which requires adult
  supervision. Feel free to contact us beforehand if you want to check suit

 will delve into the world of coding using the innovative BBC Microbit and 
 Neopixels. This hands-on session is tailored to match the Key Stage 3 & 4 
 computing curriculum\, making it a valuable addition to your child’s edu
 cation while keeping it fun and engaging. \nIn the workshop children will 
 create a simple device that changes the lights\, teaching them essential p
 rogramming concepts such as variables\, loops\, conditionals\, and functio
 ns. The workshop is more than just a coding lesson\; it’s an introductio
 n to how technology integrates into various aspects of our industries\, fr
 om manufacturing to creative arts. \nThis session is a fantastic way for y
 our child to see the real-world impact of technology and to spark their in

 we convened a group of artists\, technologists\, designers and activists t
 o start the project. As result of the connections made\, we have identifie
 d themes and ideas that we will present in this talk. The five themes are 
 Community\, Sustainability\, Software\, Hardware and Creative. Within each
  of these themes\, we've identified four main areas of concern. The purpos
 e of this talk would be to relate our progress up to this point and to gal
 vanise further collaboration with the EMF community. We are a pair of arti

DESCRIPTION:Controlling websites with an Arduino is like magic. Suddenly l
 ittle bits of hardware can control all kinds of games and interfaces on sc
 reens. And building a UI for your electronics becomes trivial too.\n\nThis
  is a talk for anyone who’s ever tinkered with hardware or web design\, 
 and wants to join the physical to the digital. \n\nDuring this talk I will
  explain the basic techniques of keyboard emulation and using the Javascri
 pt Web Serial and Web Bluetooth APIs. To make it fun\, and introduce some 
 peril\, I will demo all of the techniques live: controlling the Google Chr
 ome Dino game by jumping up and down on stage\, making a musical instrumen
 t from stretchy rubber and allowing audience members to connect to a set o
 f handbells from their phones.\n\nAlong the way will be plenty of tips on 
 what to buy and what to avoid\, I’ll demystify some of the complexity ar
 ound Bluetooth and USB\, and share several ideas for how to use this to ca
 use mischief amongst friends\, colleagues and enemies.\n\nI have done this
  before\, but only once. Fingers crossed.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org

DESCRIPTION:Tempeh is a traditional Indonesian food made from soybeans fer

 sporus" spores. While the beans are simmering\, we will look a bit into th

 a tiny wearable incubator (= petri dish on a lanyard)\, fill it with the p
 repared tempeh culture\, incubate it over the next 48 hours with his or he
 r own body heat\, and watch the mycelium grow.\n\nThe lanyards will also p
 rovide an excellent conversation starter during the festival and help to s
 pread the tempeh love.\n\n"Rhizopus oligosporus" is a very robust culture\
 , which outcompetes any other bacteria and fungi. Provided you are not all
 ergic to soy\, making tempeh is as safe as making other fermented foods (l
 ike sourdough or yoghurt). \n\n(Shout out to Maud and Antoine from Domingo

 nce schedule are not real — they're only a placeholder. I expect to do 1
  a day\, Thursday through Sunday. I'll email you as soon as I'm able (whic
 h might be day-of)\, to tell you when to come after I decide actual times 
 — based on responses to the sign-up form\, group coordination\, my own s
 chedule & spoons\, brightness\, & weather. I am not likely to be able to d

 ht\, but that's TBD.\n\n## Mandatory:\n* Sign up using the form at https:/
 /s.ai/emf/ws\n* Be completely sober.\n* Have at least 1.5 hours free (pref
 erably 2).\n* Watch my CCC talk about this: https://s.ai/ccc You'll learn 
 much more if we can focus on what I can't show in the talk.\n\n## Very str
 ongly encouraged: \n* Bring a friend or prior participant to act as your a
 ssistant\, and sign up as one to pass it on to others. The two experiences
  are very different\, and are both valuable — and I can't teach as many 
 people simultaneously without help.\n* Pee\, drink\, and wash your hands b
 eforehand.\n* Wear clothing that leaves head and arms uncovered\, and thin
  shoes that let you feel the ground.\n* Give feedback afterwards at https:
 //s.ai/emf/fb\n* Use a group coordination code on the sign-up form to get 
 scheduled with your friends etc.\n\n## Special:\nI may run additional besp
 oke workshops\, at different times\, if you:\n1. have visual impairment th
 at may benefit from cane use\, whether or not you've had O&M\;\n2. have ot
 her disabilities that would benefit from doing this 1-on-1 (e.g. Deaf or w
 heelchair user)\;\n3. work professionally with cane users or in very low v
 isibility environments\;\n4. are part of EMF staff\, volunteers\, etc.\;\n
 5. can video record the workshop (e.g. stabilised GoPro)\, or participate 
 on camera\; or\n6. have some other good reason for me to do an extra sessi
 on or in a bespoke manner.\n\nIf any of that applies to you\, please indic
 ate it on the sign-up form\, and include all times that could work for you
  — including day 0 (Thursday).\n\n## Weather\n\nIf it's raining\, or the
  ground is still muddy from recent rain\, the workshop will be cancelled. 
 \n\nThere's one exception: if you have visual impairment\, it's still on. 
 (You need to know how to get around no matter what the weather is.)\n\nAtt
 ending this workshop will cost: Before & after online surveys so I can ass

 h a script find an illustrator? It's even more difficult if your project p
 rioritizes social and environmental justice over profit. Until... soon\, m
 aybe?!\n\nTo save humanity from itself\, we need inventions and creations 
 that the FTSE 500 will never provide. Let's meet and discuss how we can bu
 ild a network to connect people with the ideas\, skills\, knowledge\, time

  determined what I believe to be the best number in Morse Code too.\nFrom 
 steganography to lexical anomalies we explore the delights of this not exa
