It\u2019s based on a hacked version of Karafun software, so comes with all the songs available through the platform (~50,000). \r\n\r\nEnjoy such classic songs as Street Turpentine (by Neil Diamond), Mr Horsehide (by the Killers), and Barracuda (by Jeff Buckley) \r\n\r\nWhere some parody songs may take liberties with the scansion and rhyme scheme of the original, Karaobot has been explicitly programmed to always match the stress and rhyme structure of the original - so you should find that if you know the original song, singing the new words should come fairly naturally! (Disclaimer: while the new lyrics will scan and rhyme, there are no promises made about the coherence of the lyrics)\r\n\r\nIn addition, custom words and phrases can be pre-loaded into the system, which will show up within the generated lyrics; these will be crowd-sourced EMF in-jokes from festival attendees to be used in the karaoke.\r\n",

Many many experimentations later, lead to a Crawly prototype, which 5 mins after turning on, we realised it was not only adept and surmounting any number of challenging terrains... it was also a fantastic dancer!\r\n\r\nFunding helped us build a troupe of 4 Crawlybots that we have taken to many public engagement events, and allowed hundreds of kids to take control of the Crawlybots via remote control and FPV drone goggles. The bots bring joy wherever they go, across all ages, even among hard hearted roboticists. \r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on having all our robot 'guts' on show, so we can talk about all the great things like Teensys, coding, lipo batteries, BMS's's, esp32s, 3D printing, education, learning through play, sustainability, CNC, laser cutting and all sorts of interesting stuff.\r\n\r\nFun fact!

The drawing process is mesmerising to watch: a brilliant green dot precisely sears lines into the screen at about 5x the speed of a person drawing quickly. Half the fun is guessing what's being drawn as the image slowly forms. When it's done, there's a pause and then the double-flash of the screen blanking itself before a new drawing begins. Overall, it's an intriguing mix of analog and digital.\r\n\r\nVisitors can press a key to interrupt free-running mode and select one of the graphics from an on-screen menu, or they can just sit back and watch as the computer cycles through them automatically.\r\n\r\nThe 4006-1 makes use of a forgotten display technology: the direct-view storage tube. This unique cathode-ray tube retains anything drawn to it, like a glowing Etch-a-Sketch: there's no flicker, no refresh, and (because vectors) not even any pixels. When computers were slow and memory was expensive, a vector storage tube was a practical way to achieve high-resolution graphics, particularly for line drawings, CAD diagrams, schematics, graphs, maps, and similar imagery. Tektronix (most known for oscilloscopes) made storage-tube based computers and terminals from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, when more familiar technologies finally gained an unbeatable edge.",

So we decided to build a giant 7-segment display out of fluorescent tubes.\r\nYou've actually seen Fluroclock v1 at EMF22, this year it's coming back better and more reliable, being controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller and Modbus",

Since then it has been deconstructed and in storage. EMF 2024 has freed its constituent parts which await reconstruction / reconfiguration. \r\n\r\nBorn out of the collision of pinball and pachinko with theories of computing and artificial life, Supercomputer is a composing machine in which the flow of ball bearings, carrying information through labyrinthine circuits of mechanical computational units, calculates minimal melodic phrases.\r\n\r\nAs a work of art, Supercomputer relates as much to Jean Tinguely's sculptural machines and Sol LeWitt's instruction-based drawings and structures, as to Cambridge's seminal position in the history of computing, in particular the work of Alan Turing and John Conway.\r\n\r\nThe process implicit in Supercomputer, a one dimensional cellular automata, is a simplification of Conway's Game of Life; a self-organising system in which each output (result) is fed back to become the next input. Supercomputer's form is a direct consequence of this computation. The process, understood as an abstract set of instructions, dictates the physical, mechanical and visual aspects of the sculpture. Form follows function.\r\n\r\nAlthough nothing is random in Supercomputer's computation - for each of its 8192 possible settings the sculpture's computational process is distinct and deterministic - indeterminacy is introduced through bugs, resulting in unique compositions in which micro-minimal melodies ate accompanied by sounds of the work in process, the complex sonic patterns of Supercomputer's calculations.\r\n\r\nFor more information and documentation visit supercomputer.org.uk",

The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 from Brave New World (Aldous Huxley 1932)\r\n\r\nStep up to a device that is half-plant, half-machine. It pulsates with light. Vines intertwined around its body. This is The Scent Organ, and you are invited to play it. You can choose different species of plants, combine them any way you wish, and then play back their aromas. Will you make something beautiful? Evocative? Or whimsical?\r\n\r\nCuriosity piqued, you look at myriad glass vessels containing eight solutions of plant essential oils, carrying each plant\u2019s unique fragrance. Select up to three fragrances at a time, using a tactile, playful interface built around glass jars. Pull the lever to release your mixture of ultrasonically-atomised essential oils, and smell your creation. An invigorating scent of peppermint, crisp and refreshing. A small adjustment adds the soothing aroma of lavender, evoking calm and tranquillity. Yet another jar shifted mixes in a dissonant but energising scent of black pepper.\r\n\r\nUsing The Scent Organ, we invite you to explore scent as a means to play with plants, evoke hidden memories, and even create scents that have never been smelled before\u2026",
