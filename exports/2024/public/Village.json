This year the Maths Village will be one of EMF's Workshop Villages, hosting workshops from the main programme alongside their own content. Last EMF, we had a selection of hands-on maths puzzles, free maths magazines, interactive gadgets and games, dome-building workshops, face painting and a MathsJam evening. If you're a big maths fan already, or want to get into it (or back into it) you're welcome to join us to do some maths, and see what exciting stuff we've come up with this time.",

We invite people from musical and non musical backgrounds to gather round and play collaboratively.\r\n\r\nThe more you explore the stump, the more it has to offer, feel it, whack it, speak to it and see what you receive.\r\n\r\nIt creates inspiration, creativity and silliness like no other instrument. Coming from the roots to create magical sounds.\r\n\r\nIt has sound effects and amplification to create an atmospheric mode. The stump works well as the soul compound instrument in a jam or can be used to integrate other instruments.\r\n\r\nBe careful when you visit, you might loose an hour or two!\r\n\r\nCheck out the instagram:\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/synestreesia_wood_stories/\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jazzcousins/",
