Conventional hardware architectures and the C/C++ codebase are chronically prone to exploitable errors - a 75-year-old problem at the heart of computing.  \r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce CHERI, showing how (finally?!) we can do better.  The CHERI research project has developed a new architecture+software approach, using unforgeable hardware capabilities to implement pointers. Morello is an Arm experimental platform for evaluation of CHERI to explore its potential for mass-market adoption, part-funded by the UKRI Digital Security by Design programme, and other groups are developing CHERI-enabled RISC-V processors, including Microsoft, Google, lowRISC, SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, and RISC-V International. \r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the problem, and CHERI and Morello, for a broad audience: the hardware extensions, their potential for fine-grained memory safety and software compartmentalisation, the CHERI software stack, and machine-checked mathematical proof that the architecture design provides the intended security. CHERI complements alternative high-level-language approaches, that would need code to be rewritten from scratch, and we'll talk about the often-low cost of porting code to CHERI. \r\n\r\nI'll demo how CHERI prevents exploitable memory safety errors on a Morello box,  running Arm CHERI hardware and a complete CHERI software stack.\r\n\r\nThis is joint work by the CHERI and Morello teams at the University of Cambridge, Arm, SRI International, and the University of Edinburgh.

Speak it, of course!\r\n\r\nLike many programmers and heavy computer users, I suffer from chronic hand pain aggravated by computer keyboard use (often called repetitive strain injury, or RSI). After having mild symptoms for years, in 2019 my hand pain worsened from irritating to unignorable. Eventually I got desperate enough to try to learn to code by voice. To my surprise, it worked.\r\n\r\nSpeech recognition technology has advanced dramatically in the past decade, but most people\u2019s ideas about voice-driven UI are based on highly limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, powerful but imprecise tools like LLMs, or special-purpose dictation tools. What does a voice interface for precise control by expert users look like?\r\n\r\nA small but growing community of programmers, many affected by RSI, have been developing tools that explore this question. I use one such tool, called Talon, to control my computer, write and edit computer code, and even to write my dissertation. In this talk, I will live-demo how I edit code by voice, as well as tackling the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is voice-coding like? What unique challenges does it present?\r\n2. How do voice control systems like Talon work under the hood?\r\n3. Could voice coding ever be *better* than typing?\r\n4.

In rural areas, we often lose cellular wireless signal entirely, even within highly technologically advanced economies such as the UK, EU, US etc. We then find that we are unable to send or receive text messages, even emergency messages. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, visionary scientists and engineers developed alternative voice and messaging systems, using satellites as their \u2018flying\u2019 cell towers. We will discuss an example of such a pioneering network, called Iridium, which has operated successfully from the late 1990s right up to the present day. Today\u2019s scientist and engineer visionaries are now proposing that the same \u2018space-based\u2019 capabilities could be added to our everyday smartphones, without needing to purchase a separate satellite-messaging device.

Desktop computers can use the internet for time, but you still have to tell it what zone you're in.\r\n\r\nReally, it should be possible to build a clock with nothing more than a GPS receiver, which figures out the time on its own, with no need for internet or cellular connection.

We have a studio in London where we do pen plotting, tinkering, crafting, and making with robots and machines. You\u2019re welcome to join me at our van (what3words: smoker.evolution.coolest) for interactive ad-hoc crafting sessions and a friendly chat on all things crafting, cutting, vinyl, heat pressing, or even pen plotters if you\u2019re interested.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to let you get involved in designing and pressing, or watch and learn. \r\n\r\nI will have a variety of supplies on hand, including types of vinyl, heat transfer, infusible ink, and adhesive vinyl. I can discuss the differences between all of these and the sorts of projects you might consider each one for.\r\n\r\nWe intend on hosting you at our camper van, wherever we\u2019re parked, but if you\u2019re interested or have questions, you\u2019re welcome to fill in this form and I can keep you posted on where we\u2019ll be:\r\n\r\nhttps://forms.gle/qe8rhssk87bFrgMZ7\r\n\r\n- I can help customise something you already have for \u00a35 - be it a cotton shirt, a mug, a water bottle, or a tumbler, I will have supplies available to customise something you already have on hand - If you have a blank cotton t-shirt and an SVG design file, we can even look at creating a logo or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (one colour designs only). There is a cost of \u00a35 per item to cover supplies, but it could be a fun way to bring new life into something you already have. Mugs and tumblers will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I have. I have a variety of colours, including foil designs to customise with. Please bring supplies with you for this, I will not have anything extra. For T-shirts, any cotton shirt will do; I usually pick mine up from Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s, where they have many options in different colours.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in designing something new, I will have a small variety of blanks available for customisation and purchase while stocks last.\r\n- 12 oz coffee mugs (\u00a312) - You can use sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs suitable for cutting out, or I have some infusible ink pens for drawn designs that would work great with these mugs\r\n- Accessory bags (large: \u00a320; and small: \u00a318): I can customise these bags using Heat Transfer vinyl, which is great for monograms or simple designs. I have access to a design library if you need ideas for what to include with your bag designs. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags with a navy blue base and natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in black, natural, navy, or pink. I have a couple of pre-made options available too.\r\n- 20 oz skinny tumblers (\u00a330) - Using sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs, these are great for cut-out designs\r\n- Sublimation t-shirts (\u00a324) (Small\u2014large sizes; I have some XL, but I think they run small, so please check with me on sizes)\u2014These are sublimation t-shirt blanks and would work with the infusible ink transfer sheets and infusible ink pens.

As told by the prophet DJ Bad Boy, we drink a bottle of Bucky and get out wur chicken.\r\n\r\nThis blessed wine, produced by Benedictine Monks in Devon, bloody England, is carefully, lovingly barrel aged to a smooth, steady 15% alcohol and is imbued in a holy ceremony with a blessed 280mg of caffeine. Safe passage across the Border has been assured by the Buckfast Accord of 1669 for even the bloody English appreciate that to starve Scotland of its key religious artifact will result in an invasive war and oppressive occupation. This is the source of the common phrase \"Buckfast gets you fucked fast\" - the leading word \"Nae\" was dropped due to a misunderstanding of intent during the Victorian era, and now the phrase is a common celebration and acknowledgement of the intensity of the Rites.\r\n\r\nWhen consumed in the appropriate manner (directly from the bottle, completed in roughly 1 hour) it will aid you in seeing through time and being particularly of the moment. Often, first time participants of the Drinkers Rites will find upon completion of their experience that they have voluntarily shed themselves of all material possessions. This is to be expected - when you are accelerated to the Blessed Plane of Existence, the whisperings of ancient gods and creatures that exist between dimensions will often assist the realisation that material possessions are temporary, but Tonic Experiences are for life.\r\n\r\nA note of caution to all prospective disciples, however - the intensity of your experience may transfer all the joy contained in your soul to be used tomorrow and expend it during the ritual. This transfer often leads to a despondent day, where one reflects only upon the negative aspects of life. Do not fret, to experience the highest of highs we must understand that with which it contrasts. The despair of the day after, coupled with the infamous Jakey Shakes and occasional rejections of all food and liquid are only temporary.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the journey as set out by The Wine, produced by the most blessed monks of Devonshire. It teaches us that while all shall return to equilibrium, to break from normality for just a moment of time may bring incredible joy.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you join Scots of all shapes and sizes at the nearest consular outpost on Friday to experience the Friday Nite Rites. It must be noted, the numbers stamped on the base of the bottle are a measure of ritual experience, and acolytes may start you on a high number (indicating low intensity), restricting the blessed Number 1 bottle for only the most revered members of the encampment.\r\n", "type": "performance", "video_privacy": null, "is_fave": false, "is_family_friendly": false, "is_from_cfp": false, "content_note": null, "source": "database", "link": "https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/668-friday-nite-rites-the-bottle-opens", "video": {"recording_lost": false}, "start_time": "19:00", "end_time": "20:00"}, {"id": 781, "slug": "the-matrix-inspired-looks-drop-in-face-makeup-session", "start_date": "2024-05-31 17:30:00", "end_date": "2024-05-31 20:30:00", "venue": "Tekhn\u0113-cal Village", "latlon": [52.04032632020346, -2.378844010641359], "map_link": "https://map.emfcamp.org/#18.5/52.04032632020346/-2.378844010641359/m=52.04032632020346,-2.378844010641359", "title": "'The Matrix' inspired looks - drop-in face makeup session for all genders", "speaker": "Emily Robertson", "pronouns": null, "user_id": 618, "description": "Prepare for your Friday night gigs, meetups, or film screening with a look inspired by 1999 classic 'The Matrix'!

Artists and their shows constantly seek the latest lighting & video technology, intricate stage setups, and top-notch audio quality to dazzle fans. Ticket sales are a major revenue stream for Artists, and a high-quality production show, sells tickets.\r\n\r\nThis high level of production is only possible because of an industry full of talented roadies. Behind every arena or stadium show lies a hundreads of engineers tirelessly setting up, operating, and dismantling these elaborate stage setups, often in a new venue, on a daily basis. Long gone are the days of makeshift equipment cobbled together, roadies now navigate highly sophisticated AV control systems supported by intricate network infrastructures.\r\n\r\nA vast array of specialised hardware caters specifically to live events, engineered to be both flexible for on-the-fly adjustments and durable for daily setup and teardown. Reliability is paramount, with equipment expected to perform flawlessly show after show, never missing a beat. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we are going to take an overview into the world of live event production, shedding light on how roadies consistently deliver stellar performances day in and day out. We'll explore the intricacies of AV networks, offering an insightful overview of the behind-the-scenes magic that brings unforgettable concerts to life.\r\n", "type": "talk", "video_privacy": "public", "is_fave": false, "is_family_friendly": true, "is_from_cfp": true, "content_note": "", "source": "database", "link": "https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/450-how-roadies-became-network-engineers", "video": {"ccc": "https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-450-how-roadies-became-network-engineers", "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66xyxAqT00c", "preview_image": "https://static.media.ccc.de/media/events/emf/2024/450-103759a0-37c3-58c0-84e2-0fa76bd0f297_preview.jpg", "recording_lost": false}, "start_time": "14:50", "end_time": "15:20"}, {"id": 621, "slug": "botato-wars", "start_date": "2024-06-01 15:00:00", "end_date": "2024-06-01 16:00:00", "venue": "Youth Workshop", "latlon": [52.041512, -2.37754], "map_link": "https://map.emfcamp.org/#18.5/52.041512/-2.37754/m=52.041512,-2.37754", "title": "Botato Wars", "speaker": "Ross Atkin", "pronouns": "He / Him", "user_id": 1903, "description": "Participants make app-controlled fighting robots made from potatoes and other veggies and then they fight (and have a race if there's room).

Maybe you don't trust a cloud-hosted service with your highly classified information, or perhaps you like to build things for yourself. In this light-hearted talk, you will learn how to make a real-time on-device GenAI-powered application that can live transcribe and summarize conversations without internet access, using open-source components.\r\n\r\nOur journey begins with an introduction to open-source LLMs and the latest trends in running GenAI tools on your own hardware. We will build up our application step-by-step, first creating a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeline, then an LLM-based conversation summarization layer, presented within a Streamlit frontend, with conversation summaries sent to a lightweight Django API backend for storage.\r\n\r\nHere's why this matters:\r\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Cloud-hosted SaaS tools cannot store highly sensitive information.\r\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Good open-source alternatives exist for most GenAI tasks; the more people who use them, the more they will thrive.\r\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Commercial tools will solve for common use cases, but developers can build personalised tools that are highly specialised for their own bespoke needs.\r\n\r\nThis talk is tailored for Python enthusiasts and requires no ML expertise. By seeing a practical demo come together piece by piece, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to build their own complex Generative AI applications and be pushed to imagine what they could make for themselves using on-device computation in real-world scenarios.

Coming at the project from 3 very different points of expertise, we worked with mums to design and make a touch interactive quilt.\r\nWe asked mothers of young babies to describe their emotions around feeding, a topic often emotional and controversial, and send a voice clip along with a piece of their baby\u2019s clothing which we stitched together to create a special interactive quilt. The quilt is embedded with electronic touch sensors which activate the clips when the metal buttons of the clothes are touched. By interacting with them you can hear the stories through headphones. All this results in a very intimate and emotional experience that provides a platform for visibility and understanding and we think is a great conversation starter to share stories and create community. \r\nThe talk will include a timeline of how we created a digitally augmented quilt, and a few thoughts if you want to make one too.

If we meet by the entrance to the Lounge - we'll find some outside space.\r\n\r\nThankfully crime in a public space is rare. But it\u2019s common for an adult or child to be worried, anxious or even frightened when walking around on their own, or engaging socially outside their home, especially during winter evenings. For some, these feelings have been compounded by isolation during lockdown. Although difficult situations seldom arise, the unexpected can happen.\r\n\r\nI offer an interactive workshop, designed for adults and children -  over 10 years old who are beginning to experience greater independence from their parents or guardians. This newfound freedom comes with some risk, which can be substantially reduced using some straightforward preparation and techniques.\r\n\r\nMy workshop empowers and encourages adults and children to take responsibility for their own safety, giving them confidence.\r\n\r\nAs a father of three I know the incredible confidence kids experience when they feel able to navigate our world - and the reassurance that can give to parents and carers. I\u2019d love to pass my knowledge and advice to you and your children.\r\n\r\nI focus on spatial awareness, avoiding uncomfortable situations and confrontation, simple planning, safe conduct whilst on the street, and what to do in an emergency situation. Key areas covered:\r\n\r\n- Preparing yourself: planning/clothing/valuables/bags\r\n\r\n- On the move: street awareness/danger areas/safe areas/what to do in an emergency\r\n\r\n- Mobile phone security: IMEI/contacts/emergency calls\r\n\r\n- Travelling on a bus/train: planning journeys/safety at bus stop/station and on bus/train\r\n\r\nI have current DBS clearance, Safe Guarding Level 1 and First Aid qualifications.
