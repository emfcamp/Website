You can expect plenty of exercises, as well as inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes. You\u2019ll cover the basics of programming in Python, as well as useful libraries and tools such as Jupyter notebooks, pandas, and Matplotlib.\r\n\r\nIn this hands-on workshop, you\u2019ll work through a series of beginner-friendly materials at your own pace. You\u2019ll work within small groups, each with an assigned mentor, who will be there to help you with any questions or whenever you get stuck. All you\u2019ll need to bring is a laptop that can connect to the internet and a willingness to learn!\r\n\r\n\u2b50 Our goal is to increase inclusivity and provide a safe community for Python and Data Science.

After years of feeling useless, Hex seizes the chance to change her future by journeying to the Wishing Wyrm, a legendary dragon that will grant a single wish once a century. Unfortunately, Hex isn't the only one after the wish, and every rival wish hunter has magic on their side. Every rival except the Clanksmiths, Cam and Fuse. Like Hex, they can't do magic, but they've learned to build clank, creations made using the mysterious, forgotten arts of science and engineering.\r\n\r\nAfter a fairy fiasco throws Hex and the Clanksmiths together, they agree to cooperate - for the time being. With the Clanksmiths' know-how and Hex's creativity, they outsmart monsters with everything from LEDs to electromagnets to water balloon launchers. But as they race to the Wishing Wyrm, Hex must decide between her friendship with the Clanksmiths and the wish that would give her a normal, magical life.",

Sailors, especially, embraced macram\u00e9 for practical purposes during their lengthy sea journeys. The Victorian era witnessed a revival of interest in England, and throughout the 20th century, macram\u00e9 maintained its popularity with artists and crafters exploring innovative designs and materials. Nowadays the craft has evolved beyond its traditional forms and utilitarian purposes, with contemporary artists pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with knotting techniques.\r\n\r\nNo prior experience is needed\u2014just bring your enthusiasm, curiosity, and creative spirit. Children under 10 are welcome with parental supervision.\r\n\r\nI'll provide cord and easy-to-follow instructions for several beginner-friendly projects.\r\n\r\nUnder-16s must be accompanied by an adult, and both must have a ticket for this workshop.",

I can discuss the differences between all of these and the sorts of projects you might consider each one for.\r\n\r\nWe intend on hosting you at our camper van, wherever we\u2019re parked, but if you\u2019re interested or have questions, you\u2019re welcome to fill in this form and I can keep you posted on where we\u2019ll be:\r\n\r\nhttps://forms.gle/qe8rhssk87bFrgMZ7\r\n\r\n- I can help customise something you already have for \u00a35 - be it a cotton shirt, a mug, a water bottle, or a tumbler, I will have supplies available to customise something you already have on hand - If you have a blank cotton t-shirt and an SVG design file, we can even look at creating a logo or design using my heat transfer vinyl stash (one colour designs only). There is a cost of \u00a35 per item to cover supplies, but it could be a fun way to bring new life into something you already have. Mugs and tumblers will hold up well with the adhesive vinyl that I have. I have a variety of colours, including foil designs to customise with. Please bring supplies with you for this, I will not have anything extra. For T-shirts, any cotton shirt will do; I usually pick mine up from Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s, where they have many options in different colours.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in designing something new, I will have a small variety of blanks available for customisation and purchase while stocks last.\r\n- 12 oz coffee mugs (\u00a312) - You can use sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs suitable for cutting out, or I have some infusible ink pens for drawn designs that would work great with these mugs\r\n- Accessory bags (large: \u00a320; and small: \u00a318): I can customise these bags using Heat Transfer vinyl, which is great for monograms or simple designs. I have access to a design library if you need ideas for what to include with your bag designs. The large bags are dipped base canvas bags with a navy blue base and natural top. The small cosmetic bags come in black, natural, navy, or pink. I have a couple of pre-made options available too.\r\n- 20 oz skinny tumblers (\u00a330) - Using sublimation / infusible ink papers with pre-printed designs, these are great for cut-out designs\r\n- Sublimation t-shirts (\u00a324) (Small\u2014large sizes; I have some XL, but I think they run small, so please check with me on sizes)\u2014These are sublimation t-shirt blanks and would work with the infusible ink transfer sheets and infusible ink pens. Also, if you\u2019re curious why you can do sublimation on some shirts but not on others, come by and chat with me about the different materials.",

Many many experimentations later, lead to a Crawly prototype, which 5 mins after turning on, we realised it was not only adept and surmounting any number of challenging terrains... it was also a fantastic dancer!\r\n\r\nFunding helped us build a troupe of 4 Crawlybots that we have taken to many public engagement events, and allowed hundreds of kids to take control of the Crawlybots via remote control and FPV drone goggles. The bots bring joy wherever they go, across all ages, even among hard hearted roboticists. \r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on having all our robot 'guts' on show, so we can talk about all the great things like Teensys, coding, lipo batteries, BMS's's, esp32s, 3D printing, education, learning through play, sustainability, CNC, laser cutting and all sorts of interesting stuff.\r\n\r\nFun fact!

It explores the fragility of life, its circularity, invites people to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our legacy as humans moving into an increasingly digital age. \r\n\r\nSince January 2024, Peasgood & Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC, a newly-developed process which builds on Google Magenta\u2019s DDSP by combining it with a diffusion-based vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 and trained models which can be mapped onto Emily\u2019s voice enabling her to sound younger and older than she is. \r\n\r\nThis technology is starting to be adopted by contemporary pop musicians, high-profile examples being web services such as Grimes\u2019 Elf and Holly Herndon\u2019s Holly+. \r\n\r\nEverSong represents a new application of this technology by making it possible to hear a voice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathways, installed sustainably in nature, touring before finding a permanent home in an ancient site.",

If we meet by the entrance to the Lounge - we'll find some outside space.\r\n\r\nThankfully crime in a public space is rare. But it\u2019s common for an adult or child to be worried, anxious or even frightened when walking around on their own, or engaging socially outside their home, especially during winter evenings. For some, these feelings have been compounded by isolation during lockdown. Although difficult situations seldom arise, the unexpected can happen.\r\n\r\nI offer an interactive workshop, designed for adults and children -  over 10 years old who are beginning to experience greater independence from their parents or guardians. This newfound freedom comes with some risk, which can be substantially reduced using some straightforward preparation and techniques.\r\n\r\nMy workshop empowers and encourages adults and children to take responsibility for their own safety, giving them confidence.\r\n\r\nAs a father of three I know the incredible confidence kids experience when they feel able to navigate our world - and the reassurance that can give to parents and carers. I\u2019d love to pass my knowledge and advice to you and your children.\r\n\r\nI focus on spatial awareness, avoiding uncomfortable situations and confrontation, simple planning, safe conduct whilst on the street, and what to do in an emergency situation. Key areas covered:\r\n\r\n- Preparing yourself: planning/clothing/valuables/bags\r\n\r\n- On the move: street awareness/danger areas/safe areas/what to do in an emergency\r\n\r\n- Mobile phone security: IMEI/contacts/emergency calls\r\n\r\n- Travelling on a bus/train: planning journeys/safety at bus stop/station and on bus/train\r\n\r\nI have current DBS clearance, Safe Guarding Level 1 and First Aid qualifications.

I love to see them add to it each day and have this long connected machine using all the above and explain where each item is used in every day situations. I'd like this to grow into a live installation, people could label their part like a exhibition of their skill. If possible, it would be great to try make parts of it a marble run. I have lots of wheels, they can have a contest on the last day of who can make their car travel the furthest down a ramp, or balloon/elastic band powered. \r\n\r\nI want them to have fun building and seeing things connected, but I'd like to show examples where what they've built takes place. Maybe I could squeeze a bit of my science knowledge of what's going on in too.\r\n\r\nI'll keep tweaking this but I wanted to get this idea through to you and I'm happy for suggestions, tweaks.

That\u2019s an issue because pollution levels can vary a lot even between adjacent streets so to get the best picture possible we need more sensors! This is where citizen lead projects like Sensor.Community are doing amazing things.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop you\u2019ll put together an air quality monitor made from an ESP8266 and a few sensors, load up the firmware and connect it to the sensor.community network so that other people, scientists and policy makers can see where the problems are and hopefully change something. We\u2019ll discuss options for weather proofing, where to place the sensor and how to hook it into your own smart home setup if you have one. \r\n\r\nI will be selling kits at cost which include:\r\n    - An ESP8266 Dev board with micro USB port\r\n    - A BME280 Pressure/Temp/Humidity sensor\r\n    - A 2m micro USB cable\r\n    - F-F header cables\r\n    - An SDS011 particulate matter sensor\r\n    - A USB power supply **is not** included, let's try to prevent some e-waste by reusuing an old one! \r\n\r\nI currently have 10 kits including the SDS011 for \u00a340 and an additional 20 with just the BME280 for \u00a315. You will need to bring your own usb power supply or plug it into a laptop and I will leave the weather proofing up to you once you install it at home.\r\n\r\nI can accept payment in cash (exact change only please!), contactless or bank transfer. I don't have a physical card reader so can't accept chip and pin payments only contactless. \r\n\r\nA special shoutout will go to anyone who:\r\n- Scrounges together the parts for a sensor purely from things they get at the camp!\r\n- Get the firmware running on the EMFcamp badge!\r\n- Makes an airquality themed Hexpansion for the badge!\r\n- Does something else unexpected with the idea, it's a citizen lead project after all!\r\n\r\n[1]: https://sensor.community/en/sensors/airrohr/\r\n\r\nUnder-16s must be accompanied by an adult, and both must have a ticket for this workshop.",

It's even more difficult if your project prioritizes social and environmental justice over profit. Until... soon, maybe?!\r\n\r\nTo save humanity from itself, we need inventions and creations that the FTSE 500 will never provide.
