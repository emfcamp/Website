Conventional hardware architectures and the C/C++ codebase are chronically prone to exploitable errors - a 75-year-old problem at the heart of computing.  \r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce CHERI, showing how (finally?!) we can do better.  The CHERI research project has developed a new architecture+software approach, using unforgeable hardware capabilities to implement pointers. Morello is an Arm experimental platform for evaluation of CHERI to explore its potential for mass-market adoption, part-funded by the UKRI Digital Security by Design programme, and other groups are developing CHERI-enabled RISC-V processors, including Microsoft, Google, lowRISC, SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, and RISC-V International. \r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the problem, and CHERI and Morello, for a broad audience: the hardware extensions, their potential for fine-grained memory safety and software compartmentalisation, the CHERI software stack, and machine-checked mathematical proof that the architecture design provides the intended security. CHERI complements alternative high-level-language approaches, that would need code to be rewritten from scratch, and we'll talk about the often-low cost of porting code to CHERI. \r\n\r\nI'll demo how CHERI prevents exploitable memory safety errors on a Morello box,  running Arm CHERI hardware and a complete CHERI software stack.\r\n\r\nThis is joint work by the CHERI and Morello teams at the University of Cambridge, Arm, SRI International, and the University of Edinburgh.

I am also autistic myself, which sometimes manifests as a chronic inability to give up. That's why, on 14th March, I sent the same Freedom of Information Act request to all 42 NHS Integrated Care Boards in England.\r\n\r\nWhat started as firing off a few e-mails turned very complicated very quickly; this is a whistle-stop tour of redirection, confusion, and private outsourcing.

After having mild symptoms for years, in 2019 my hand pain worsened from irritating to unignorable. Eventually I got desperate enough to try to learn to code by voice. To my surprise, it worked.\r\n\r\nSpeech recognition technology has advanced dramatically in the past decade, but most people\u2019s ideas about voice-driven UI are based on highly limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, powerful but imprecise tools like LLMs, or special-purpose dictation tools. What does a voice interface for precise control by expert users look like?\r\n\r\nA small but growing community of programmers, many affected by RSI, have been developing tools that explore this question. I use one such tool, called Talon, to control my computer, write and edit computer code, and even to write my dissertation. In this talk, I will live-demo how I edit code by voice, as well as tackling the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is voice-coding like? What unique challenges does it present?\r\n2. How do voice control systems like Talon work under the hood?\r\n3. Could voice coding ever be *better* than typing?\r\n4.

I outline some of the cutting-edge technologies involved in developing fusion power, including superconducting magnets, plasma control using deep learning methods, and hypersonic fuel injection. The audience is also given facts and figures to get a flavour of the unimaginable scale of what is being done: materials at nearly 0K adjacent to plasmas hotter than the cores of stars, gigawatts of power from teaspoons of fuel, magnetic fields multiple times more powerful than MRI machines, and neutron fluxes strong enough to transmute matter in bulk.\r\n\r\nComing away from this presentation, the audience will have learned about the fundamentals of nuclear fusion and appreciate the key issues enough to put the marketing and news reports into context. They might even be excited and enthused about what's to come in this quickly growing technology space.",

In rural areas, we often lose cellular wireless signal entirely, even within highly technologically advanced economies such as the UK, EU, US etc. We then find that we are unable to send or receive text messages, even emergency messages. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, visionary scientists and engineers developed alternative voice and messaging systems, using satellites as their \u2018flying\u2019 cell towers. We will discuss an example of such a pioneering network, called Iridium, which has operated successfully from the late 1990s right up to the present day. Today\u2019s scientist and engineer visionaries are now proposing that the same \u2018space-based\u2019 capabilities could be added to our everyday smartphones, without needing to purchase a separate satellite-messaging device. This would allow our phone, when necessary, to switch from the land-based TN to the space-based \u2018Non-Terrestrial Network\u2019 (NTN). In this presentation we will discuss some of the technical challenges in achieving this \u2018Direct-to-Device\u2019 (D2D) satellite messaging feature, and some of the solutions which are being proposed, and even already being tested for real.

Mobile phones can sort-of do this, but they manage by listening to the cell towers, so this won't work everywhere. \"Radio controlled\" clocks just listen to a low frequency broadcast, there's a few different transmissions across the world but they're incompatible and know nothing of time zones. Desktop computers can use the internet for time, but you still have to tell it what zone you're in.\r\n\r\nReally, it should be possible to build a clock with nothing more than a GPS receiver, which figures out the time on its own, with no need for internet or cellular connection. It turns out that doing this requires an on-board world atlas, a spherical coordinate point-in-polygon algorithm, and a complete database of offsets and daylight savings rules.\r\n\r\nI finally created a clock that automatically corrects itself as you carry it across country and timezone borders. The journey to this point was so ridiculously tedious that it borders on the absurd. In this talk I'll run through some of the highlights, and of course no talk about GPS time would be complete without mentioning leap seconds, which cause problems even when they don't happen.",

We all learn from failure, right???\r\nI\u2019m sharing this info because this year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at work. It turns out that I\u2019m good at asking weird questions, and it\u2019s an extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be, then you know where they could be broken, and you can ask your vendors (and your colleagues!) \u201cweird questions\u201d before an adversary does.\r\n",

Ticket sales are a major revenue stream for Artists, and a high-quality production show, sells tickets.\r\n\r\nThis high level of production is only possible because of an industry full of talented roadies. Behind every arena or stadium show lies a hundreads of engineers tirelessly setting up, operating, and dismantling these elaborate stage setups, often in a new venue, on a daily basis. Long gone are the days of makeshift equipment cobbled together, roadies now navigate highly sophisticated AV control systems supported by intricate network infrastructures.\r\n\r\nA vast array of specialised hardware caters specifically to live events, engineered to be both flexible for on-the-fly adjustments and durable for daily setup and teardown. Reliability is paramount, with equipment expected to perform flawlessly show after show, never missing a beat. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we are going to take an overview into the world of live event production, shedding light on how roadies consistently deliver stellar performances day in and day out. We'll explore the intricacies of AV networks, offering an insightful overview of the behind-the-scenes magic that brings unforgettable concerts to life.\r\n",

This body of ancestral knowledge could help provide local food resilience, reduce the impact of the plants we eat, and better protect food supplies from climate change, pollinator loss and disease. \r\n\r\nThe research is still in its raw form as a giant spreadsheet, so the first part of the talk will focus on the process of research and identification, and some of the trickier questions such as the difference between a food and a medicine, what level of toxicity is tolerable, and how to really define a native plant. The second part will focus on some highlights of the results, including obscure disused vegetables, native things you can still forage, lost recipes for brewed alcohols and psychoactives, vegetables we've bioengineered for edibility, some exciting natural poisions, and addressing whether or not lettuce really exists.",

Armed with a PA system, rally lights, under glow and 2 car horns it\u2019s the perfect centre of chaos for protests or your ALDI shop.\r\nDuring our presentation, we invite the audience to delve into the fascinating world of motorising random objects and the art of upcycling, along with the myriad challenges we encountered along the way. From designing our own lithium-polymer batteries to countless iterations and rigorous testing, we'll discuss the intricacies of dealing with electromagnetic interference, experimenting with various motor controllers, and even designing our own from scratch. We want people to experience the shenanigans we went through and the fun we had along the way to hopefully get more people into whacky-wheeled\u2026..wehicles.\r\nBut it's not all talk! We're excited to demonstrate the trolley live, allowing you to experience first-hand the joy and sheer mayhem it brings. Our goal is to inspire you to embark on your own wacky-wheeled adventures, learning from our missteps and benefiting from our advice and tips.\r\nNo Project is ever truly done lastly we want to look into the future: The intended use cases and how we aim to share our knowledge and plans with the wider community. Our commitment to openness and collaboration means that anyone bold enough to motorise anything around them can benefit from our experiences and insights.",

A brilliant dot sears emerald trails into the screen, rendering intricate line-art without pixels. No need for video memory when the screen itself remembers!\r\n\r\nIt's mesmerising to see this special tube in action; more satisfying still to know how it works. Discover a mechanism Tektronix refined over three decades, growing from palm-sized oscilloscope readouts to 25\" computer-lab behemoths. A wreath of electron guns, kilovolt potentials, microscopic cobalt cones, and transparent anodes set the stage for a nonlinear dance of charges that yields visualisations with style --- and we'll unravel its mysteries with animated diagrams. En route we'll visit notable storage tube applications, from early computer memories to 1978's _Battlestar Galactica_. Of course we'll see a real Tektronix terminal at work, too!\r\n\r\nComputer memory is cheap now: by the mid 1980s, modern displays had advantages storage-tube systems couldn't overcome.

I'll also explain some quirks of the game... including the real reason that docking was so hard.\r\n\r\nI'll demonstrate some new tools I've developed, which access the game state in real time, letting you experience the original game in new ways - including an OpenGL frontend with VR support, and an attempt to recreate an arcade-style version of the game, with an old-school vector display.\r\n\r\nFinally, if all goes to plan, I will attempt to demonstrate something that was an impossible dream for 40 years: multiplayer Elite on the original BBC Micro version.",

In this light-hearted talk, you will learn how to make a real-time on-device GenAI-powered application that can live transcribe and summarize conversations without internet access, using open-source components.\r\n\r\nOur journey begins with an introduction to open-source LLMs and the latest trends in running GenAI tools on your own hardware. We will build up our application step-by-step, first creating a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeline, then an LLM-based conversation summarization layer, presented within a Streamlit frontend, with conversation summaries sent to a lightweight Django API backend for storage.\r\n\r\nHere's why this matters:\r\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Cloud-hosted SaaS tools cannot store highly sensitive information.\r\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Good open-source alternatives exist for most GenAI tasks; the more people who use them, the more they will thrive.\r\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Commercial tools will solve for common use cases, but developers can build personalised tools that are highly specialised for their own bespoke needs.\r\n\r\nThis talk is tailored for Python enthusiasts and requires no ML expertise. By seeing a practical demo come together piece by piece, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to build their own complex Generative AI applications and be pushed to imagine what they could make for themselves using on-device computation in real-world scenarios. Expect plenty of Python code and some fun live demos, with GitHub code provided for attendees to try it at home.",

Coming at the project from 3 very different points of expertise, we worked with mums to design and make a touch interactive quilt.\r\nWe asked mothers of young babies to describe their emotions around feeding, a topic often emotional and controversial, and send a voice clip along with a piece of their baby\u2019s clothing which we stitched together to create a special interactive quilt. The quilt is embedded with electronic touch sensors which activate the clips when the metal buttons of the clothes are touched. By interacting with them you can hear the stories through headphones. All this results in a very intimate and emotional experience that provides a platform for visibility and understanding and we think is a great conversation starter to share stories and create community. \r\nThe talk will include a timeline of how we created a digitally augmented quilt, and a few thoughts if you want to make one too.

But this is the past. Today most records are no longer on paper but sent in the form of bytes and I\u2019ve started to wonder what the point of my job really is? We have free access to near-unlimited email inboxes, all our photos are backed up to the cloud to access from anywhere, and instant messaging is synced between our devices. Why bother deciding what to keep for posterity? Just save everything, let computers do the hard work, and all will be well. \r\n\r\nThis approach unsettled me so much that I set off to explore what it would really mean if we \u201csaved everything\u201d: how this would affect our world, communities, and ourselves as humans.

Inspired by the film \"Don't Look Up\", where Benn produced the impact campaign, we will explore this dynamic together. When the ethics are no longer focused on being accurate, but rather being first,and being attention grabbing, it becomes difficult for people to discern what is and is not an important story. So we wonder how some of the most important stories either fall through the ether entirely, or are seen and dismissed by the apparatus of the 24 hour news cycle and 3 second refresh feeds. That's what films like Don't Look Up tackle so well.\r\n\r\nBenn is a SXSW Grand Jury Prize & UNICEF Prize winning, Oscar Shortlisted, Webby nominated producer. He has been a social impact advisor and producer working across film, games and events, with a mission to bridge gaps between story and policy, and ultimately champion vast perspectives to aid social movement. He is the Head of Partnerships for Neon Picturehouse, and Executive Producer & Vice-Chairman of HF Productions. He serves as an Advisor of Think Film, Global Environment Media, Screen South, SIE Society, and Treun House Atelier. Benn also consults on projects from producing Netflix impact campaigns (\u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d, \u201cBreaking Boundaries\u2026), Sony\u2019s Picture This, and SDGs in Action with UN DESA as part of the High Level Political Forum.",

But increasingly, the UK government, police, and security services are using these tools for public policy. The targeted advertising and influence platforms give public sector actors complex tools with which to target behaviour change communications - allowing them to tailor nudge messages based on online behaviour, interests, and fine-detail location. This is allowing the police to use targeted behaviour change advertising to attempt to prevent crime before it happens - but poses serious questions for accountability, ethics, and privacy.\r\n\r\nDrawing on a dataset of more than 12,000 government adverts from the Meta Ad Library and in-depth interviews with law enforcement, we map the landscape of what we call 'influence policing' in the UK, and discuss the ethical and democratic implications of this new mode of policing.",

And building a UI for your electronics becomes trivial too.\r\n\r\nThis is a talk for anyone who\u2019s ever tinkered with hardware or web design, and wants to join the physical to the digital. \r\n\r\nDuring this talk I will explain the basic techniques of keyboard emulation and using the Javascript Web Serial and Web Bluetooth APIs. To make it fun, and introduce some peril, I will demo all of the techniques live: controlling the Google Chrome Dino game by jumping up and down on stage, making a musical instrument from stretchy rubber and allowing audience members to connect to a set of handbells from their phones.\r\n\r\nAlong the way will be plenty of tips on what to buy and what to avoid, I\u2019ll demystify some of the complexity around Bluetooth and USB, and share several ideas for how to use this to cause mischief amongst friends, colleagues and enemies.\r\n\r\nI have done this before, but only once. Fingers crossed.",
