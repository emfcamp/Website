DESCRIPTION:These are not the zombies you've fragged! A bioarchaeologist a
 nd an applied philosopher will take you on a historical zombie adventure b
 eyond Romero's shambling hordes and stories about Haitian Voodoo. Did you 
 know that the D&D wondrous item: Hand of Glory was inspired by real artefa
 cts? Or that miasmic "zombification" in some video games reflects medieval
  ideas about contagion? What do past ideas about zombies tell us about zom
 bies now? And how do video game zombies reflect current ideas about ethics
 ? Also\, find out how zombies play a role in cutting-edge neuroscience and
  ICT research!\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/309

DESCRIPTION:Technology seeks to ease our aging years with humanoid resourc
 es to replace care workers and improve our quality of life. But is that th
 e answer for our 'golden' years? How do we plan and prepare for what's ahe
 ad? Depending on our genes and our jeans\, we could live into our 100s but
  a lot rides on our perception of ageing and whether we want to do what ou
 r parents have done. \n\nEdye is a social anthropologist who works embedde
 d with our older and oldest generations as they manage the challenges of a
 geing. Together\, they witness success and failure\; and they're circumspe
 ct about the power of Pepper and whether we even know what we want in our 
 80s\, 90s\, 100s and beyond.\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/

DESCRIPTION:Modern processors are amazing devices: small\, fast\, low powe
 r and getting better with every generation.\nBut the most amazing things a
 bout modern microprocessors is that they work so incredibly reliably despi
 te all their incredible complexity.\n\nThis talk is about the battle betwe
 en complexity and correctness and about how new formal verification tools 
 can be used to help you design higher performance processors that actually
  work.  I will describe the common optimisations\, the bugs that these oft
 en introduce and how open source tools such as SAT solvers and bounded mod
 el checkers can be used to find these bugs.\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.or

DESCRIPTION:The first self-balancing skateboard was made by Ben Smithers i
 n Norfolk around 2007. This inspired me to build my own in 2008 and along 
 the way I discovered how to program in C\, Arduino's\, IMU fusion algorith
 ms\, not realising this would be as hard as it turned out to be. A gyro wa
 s £160 back then\, a 3 axis IMU is now about £5\, how things have change
 d.\n\nSince then I have built one and two wheeled boards\, 2 wheeled wheel
 chair prototype and many others\, documented on YT and Instructables\, lon
 g before such gadgets came out from China\, culminating in a 3000W hubmoto
 r 1 wheeled motorcycle which I plan to bring to the camp and demonstrate. 
 I test these on Pembrey and the famous Pendine Sands beaches in Wales\, wi
 th video clips I can present.\n\nImposter credentials: I am a hospital doc
 tor not an engineer. Electronic hobbyist. Until I started this sequence of

 to better secure their services and thus protecting your privacy.\n\nAfter
  a short introduction you'll be surfing the web\, finding names\, addresse
 s and urls of the UK government and adding them to the map. They will auto
 matically be scanned for basic security. If all is well\, they are shown g
 reen\, otherwise orange or red. Expect a lot of red.\n\nThe results of our
  work will be sent to various press agencies in the UK. We hope they start
  asking questions about the sad state of security. This causes responsible
  organizations to wake up and adopt better practices\, securing your data 
 and privacy. We've seen this work in the Netherlands.\n\nYou can expect: I
 t's a lot of fun to see the amount of data grow\, and more terribleness ap

DESCRIPTION:Mexican food is becoming more and more popular in the UK and t
 he range of restaurant options is expanding\, particularly in large cities
 . However\, it is almost certainly true that most people have never had th
 e life-changing experience of tasting a truly authentic Mexican taco. Furt
 hermore\, I would imagine that most people would never think of attempting
  to make one at home\, despite the fact that it is such a simple dish.\n\n
 As a keen home-cook\, who has lived in Mexico for the past 10 years\, I am
  hoping to share this experience with people with a passion for trying new
  things.\n\nI will explain a little behind the theory of what makes a good
  taco\, as well as introduce people to the core elements and constituents.
 \n\nThis will primarily be a sensory experience where people will be able 
 to compare "good" vs. "bad" ingredients\, and learn the basics of putting 
 together a simple but delicious taco.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost
 : Nominal fee of £2 per person\nSuitable age range: 12 years and above as

DESCRIPTION:Falling generally is consider bad. It hurts at best\, sometime

  to fall even faster. Earlier this year\, CBBC wanted to accelerate a TV p
 resenter to the speed of a diving peregrine for the series “Beyond Bioni
 c”\, this required extra speed and thus the “Jet Boot” project was b
 orn. This talk will cover the technologies we used to help Andy Torbert fa
 ll even faster\, specifically the use of 3D printing to make the final sys
 tem a reality\, whilst covering some of the challenges of trying to attach
  jet engines to the human body\, not setting anyone on fire\, and the pote
 ntial of jet packs\, jet boots and other flying platforms for future trans

DESCRIPTION:How does a computer like the BBC micro:bit work? Find out by b

 participants will be able to be part of a giant micro:bit - teams will rac
 e against each other to run different programs\, each attendee being a par
 t of the machine. There’ll be a small workshop at the beginning and the 
 end so that we demystify the way computers work and understand what we're 
 all doing.\n\nThis is a good companion to other programming workshops beca
 use it turns the concept on its head\, with the participants running\, not
  writing\, programs.\n\nIt isn't just about *being* a CPU though\, our aim
  is to optimise one. After running the first program\, your team will be a
 ble to make changes to the CPU's arrangement and operation to optimise you
 rselves. If you've ever asked yourself "what does it mean to be part of a 
 5-stage pipeline?" or thought "Can I try branch prediction today?" then th
 is is definitely the workshop for you. If you don't know what those things
  are\, then this is the place to learn what it means and have some fun.\n\
 nAttending this workshop will cost: Free\nSuitable age range: 10 upwards. 
 Children under 10 who are keen on programming have had a fun time doing th
 is before\, but it's best for them to be with an adult.\nAttendees should 
 bring: Nothing\, just a sense of computing adventure.\n\nLink: http://www.

 es stories such as 'You could basically still repeat the great train robbe
 ry today\, here's how' and 'Can you stop trains with only an ISM band radi
 o?'. The speaker highly recommends none of this is applied in the real wor
 ld. It would definitely not be a good idea. Please don't. But it's nice to
  know some technical details at least.\n\nThe speaker will assume no previ
 ous knowledge and the content is appropriate for all. It would mostly appe

 evolution. In this talk I’ll discuss what lessons can we learn from that
  industry\, and how we can try to avoid making some of the same mistakes. 
 I’ll also give a basic introduction to engineering ethics\, discuss some
  examples of ethical problems from my own career\, and explore how we can 
 try to improve our ethical decision-making by incorporating ethical reason

DESCRIPTION:How can classical ballet be used a medium for computer science
  theory\, digital ethics and visualisation biometric data including EEG? W
 hat will the future hold for the human body and communication when we bold
 ly go into space? What ethical consideration must we take to ensure that i
 t is the many who control their personal data?\n\nWe’ve been making educ
 ational\, technologically exciting ballets and performance workshops for f
 ive years now. As artists we want to do collaborative learning with our au
 diences\, to help them express their own ideas within a collaborative arti
 stic technological framework. It is not just a performance to sit down and
  watch. Art and performance can break down the traditional barriers to aud
 iences that consider themselves non-technical. We like to release as much 
 of our performance and learning materials as possible as open source.\n\nO
 ur project is long-running\, and has tackled subjects from chronic pain to
  sorting algorithms. Now we are looking to space\, brain hacking\, and una
 shamed futurism. How can we begin to live in the future while increasing a
 ccessibility and inclusivity? What are the ethical concerns surrounding th
 ings that might seem abstract at first glance - like brainwave data?\n\nCl
 assical ballet might sound like a strange way to learn about technology\, 
 ethics and medicine\, but we hope to change the way you think about educat
 ion/learning. Combining the algorithmic nature of classical ballet with fu
 turistic thinking\, breaking down artificial cultural barriers and fosteri
 ng personal creative ownership for all. \n\nMay contain duct tape.\n\nLink

 tasks. But now\, scientists and industry professionals are looking into ho
 w we can adapt spider silk for our own purposes. Want a giant net that can
  catch falling Jumbos? We're on it. How about a biocompatible silk scaffol
 d to help regrow that broken bone? We're on that too. \n\nThis is a 30 min

 , but no specialist knowledge of\, science. There will be some pictures of

DESCRIPTION:A personal account of getting involved in the recreation at Th
 e National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park of EDSAC.  This was the f
 irst fully programmable general purpose computer built from 1946 to 1949 a
 t Cambridge University. It has 3000 valves and takes 12kW of power.\nI am 
 on the commissioning team finding how difficult it is to use valves (tubes
 ) as logic circuits.\n\nYou can find out more here:\n\nhttp://www.tnmoc.or

DESCRIPTION:"It's not natural!"\n\nThis phrase is often used to try and ju
 stify bigotry and prejudice\, especially against people who are LGBTQIA+\,
  polyamorous\, or women who don't fit traditional gender roles. But is it 
 true? What do we mean by "natural"?\n\nAs a bisexual\, polyamorous biologi
 st and science presenter\, Antonia Forster is keen to set the record strai
 ght (no pun intended). What behaviours do we see in nature? What's the dif
 ference between gender and sex? Can animals be gay\, bi or trans? Are ther
 e organisms with more\, or fewer\, than two sexes? Prepare to see the anim
 al kingdom as you've never seen it before...\n\nThis talk has previously b
 een delivered to 2\,000 people at TEDxBristol\, and watched by over 14\,00
 0 online. Antonia has also spoken at Wilderness Festival\, Kew Gardens\, t
 he Royal Society\, Stanford University\, Bristol Pride\, the OvalHouse The
 atre\, BCFm Radio\, and BBC Radio Bristol. Antonia has been nominated for 
 the John Maddox prize for "promoting scientific understanding in the face 
 of hostility"\; and continues to campaign for under-represented groups\, e
 specially LGBTQIA+ and women in STEM and science media.\n\nLink: http://ww

UID:142
DESCRIPTION:Making is cool\, but we talk and think a lot less about mainte
 nance. Everything we make - software\, hardware\, communities - needs to b
 e looked after\, if it is useful. Sadly\, maintaining\, repairing and sust
 aining can be challenging in a fast-moving era\, where this work can be se
 en as boring and low value\, compared to the excitement around inventing o
 r making new things. It is easy to forget that apps\, data and connected s
 ystems need maintenance too\, if they are to realise their potential and b
 e useful or fun for more than a brief moment. \n\nAnd it’s not always ea
 sy. It can be hard to find good resourcing models for long-lasting product
 s\, or for looking after new forms of shared infrastructure (such as open 
 source software libraries). Strong commons models\, where groups share and
  steward resources (whether the knowledge in Wikipedia or open hardware de
 signs) are scarce or difficult to replicate. \n\nWe’ll talk about mainte
 nance\, good and bad examples of it\, and what we are doing to recognise t
 he work done in repair\, custodianship\, stewardship\, tending and caring 
 for things that matter.  \n\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/1

DESCRIPTION:Tagline: "I almost wish there were a conspiracy\, but I'm afra
 id it's much worse than that."\n\nIt is a widely\, but vaguely\, appreciat
 ed fact that banks and banking are powerful and important aspects of moder
 n history\, which affect almost all aspects of politics and society. Most 
 thoughtful people\, reflecting on the present trajectory of history\, get 
 the uncomfortable feeling that we are all being driven toward economic\, p
 olitical and ecological disaster\, and that international banking has some
 thing to do with it.\n\nThis has made banking the focus of numerous conspi
 racy theories\, most of which contain useful and verifiable information\, 
 but all of which fail in one key respect: they all subordinate the banking
  system to the agency of secretive groups of people who supposedly control
  the whole system across generations.\n\nThe conspiracy scenario\, bad as 
 it is\, holds out the comforting thought that if we could just identify an
 d take out the shadowy figures who are really in control\, then everything
  could be put right. But what if the truth is even more terrible? What if 
 the system has its own internal logic\, like a virus or an algorithm\, whi
 ch needs no human hand to guide it?\n\nThis talk goes back to the basic pr
 inciples\, and the medieval Italian and English origins\, of the banking s
 ystem to explore its algorithmic properties. I will argue that credit syst
 ems are not only a powerful tool in the hands of human and organizations l
 ike governments and corporations\, but also that they have revolutionary e
 ffects on the priorities and and agendas of those organizations. That the 
 tool\, in other words - like Elric of Melnibone's 'Stormbringer' or Faust'
 s 'Mephistopheles' - guides the hand that seek to wield it.\n\nLink: http:

DESCRIPTION:How do people with disabilities use the internet? Accessibilit
 y and inclusive design have gained popularity recently\, but a lot of web 
 developers are still unaware of what they can do to make their sites and a
 pps work for everyone. Even with a lot of goodwill\, practical knowledge i
 s needed: it can be overwhelming to try to use a screen reader\, use the i
 nternet without a mouse\, get notifications with no audio or empathise wit
 h reading and cognitive impairments. Things like ARIA and tab order logic 
 can also be intimidating and may lead developers to make experiences worse
  when they think they are improving it.\n \nThis workshop will be part-tal
 k\, part-practical\, to demystify accessibility: why it matters\, what are
  the things to consider\, how to test and find issues\, and most important
 ly what you can do to fix them. Participants will have hands-on exercises 
 of using a screen reader on their own devices\, navigating using just a ke
 yboard\, and identify what's a good and a terrible experience. We will wor
 k on hands-on exercises with HTML and JavaScript to fix custom components\
 , understand the logic\, and for more experienced developers we will cover
  ARIA components and building accessible custom elements like accordions a

DESCRIPTION:News and media outlets on the web are silos of information des
 igned to be taken at face value and are resistant to aggregation and side-
 by-side analysis because - after all - they're really just vehicles to sel
 l ads.\n\nWhere aggregation is available to the average user (usually on s
 ocial media)\, news feeds are customized on behalf of the user with algori
 thms they can't understand or control.\n\nTo try and solve this problem fo
 r myself\, I attempted to aggregate web content via RSS feeds\, but found 
 most article bodies are just click-through links and no actual content.\n\
 nThat's why I wrote a RSS/Atom reconstitutor\, web scraper and search inde
 xer - to be able to get feeds of news\, blogs and reports I could read and
  analyze without the filter bubble.\n\nBut this talk is only a *bit* about

 nce\, news as data\, the ethics of advertising\, and subverting some hilar
 iously paper thin content protections.\n\nIn a talk for all levels of tech

DESCRIPTION:When I learned the news that I had somewhat accidentally becom
 e the owner of a Decommissioned\, 12 Storey High\, Late Soviet Era\, Water
  Tower in Latvia: naturally my first question was 'Could I use it to prop 
 up a Buran?' (The USSR's equivalent of the US Space Shuttle)...  and If I'
 d have asked that question to Woking District council\, then I'm guessing 
 the answer would be a list of regulations that would contravene - but in L
 atvia\, the answer was 'Yes\, it is your tower so you can do what you like
  with it...'\n\nAnd so I had a challenge to work out what could and should
  be done with the tower and in very British tradition a list of 101 Hacks 
 for a Water Tower was started\, which was very rapidly joined by a sister 
 list of 101 Ways to Kill Yourself on Water Tower.\n\nIn this talk I share 
 some of the journey of exploration into the wonderful world of Water Tower
 s\, Soviet Engineering\, the Baltics\, and a bit of family history. This t
 akes us from the British Water Tower Appreciation Society to Siberia and t

 aw-audio/ \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet\n\nSince the original pa
 per was published\, there has been several developments to substantially s
 peed up audio generation (several order of magnitude) in order to put it i
 nto production\, and it is now powering Google's assistant voice in severa
 l languages. See also: \n\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-goog
 le-assistant/ \nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/high-fidelity-speech-synthesis-w

 not limited to audio and can pretty much work with any signal\, but this i
 s so new that we're just scratching the surface of the potential applicati
 ons.\n\nIn my talk I will be talking about the basic tech\, what it took t

 ke to give a few suggestions and hints on how to reproduce these results: 
 the latest version (WaveRNN) is rather simple to implement and yet very po

DESCRIPTION:High Street clothing brands are developing digital machines to
  replace mass production with mass customisation. They aim to give custome
 rs more choice\, but still as consumers rather than makers. We will explor
 e how makerspaces could adapt these tools for DIY clothes making and show 
 some of the tools that are accessible now.\n\nUsing new technologies\, you
  no longer need to be a specialist to design clothes and shoes that fit pe
 rfectly. We will bring examples\, including 3D printed sandals\, a shoe la
 st and insole\, laser cut fabric and 3D printed accessories.\n\nWe will al
 so highlight textile related developments in makerspaces including the ras
 pberry pi 3D body scanner scanner we helped design at BuildBrighton\, and 
 hope to inspire more people to get involved in shaping new DIY technology.

 feedback and suggestions are offered to the participants.\n\nThe end outco

DESCRIPTION:As with many young people interested in computing\, I could ne
 ver work out how a computer could turn 1's and 0's flowing through logic g
 ates into what you see before you. You learn that this magic box can be pr
 ogrammed to do all sorts of amazing things\, but are never really given th
 e details as to how it does it. I wanted to know more\, and after some res
 earch I started making logic gates with the one bit of electronics I knew 
 how to use: Electric relays. I scrounged parts from cars\, microwaves\, sc
 rap change machines\, etc and put them together into increasingly complex 
 contraptions. Two years later\, I had TIM 8: a fully programmable 8 bit re
 lay computer. This is the story of how TIM 8 came about\, what I learnt al
 ong the way\, and how relay computers are a fantastic way to demonstrate h
 ow a computer really works.\n\nFor the talk I would bring a presentation a

 be based around a University coursework project\, where an older version o
 f web forum software "phpBB" is examined\, exploited and patched. The tech

 er trusting user input and get to see exploits such as cross-site scriptin
 g and remote code execution.\n\nLastly\, we will wrap up by patching out t

DESCRIPTION:There are a number of emoji that\, when used in digital commun
 ications\, don't always refer to their original meaning. The peach emoji\,
  for example\, has been found through research conducted by emojipedia to 
 refer most often not to the fruit\, but to buttocks. Other fruit and veget
 ables emoji have suffered a similar fate.\n\nIn this talk I will explore t
 he ways that emoji are frequently misunderstood or misused - referring to 
 some of the leading research conducted by academics in the area. I will co
 nclude with peer reviewed research that I have conducted looking at the wa
 ys we assign new meaning to emoji when communicating with a single other p
 erson. Why do we do this and how do we choose the emoji we use. Why is it 
 that despite there being a heart emoji available\, some of us choose to us
 e 🍕 to say "I love you"?\n\nThe set is presented in a stand up comedy-s
 tyle and despite discussing academic research is very accessible to any ra

DESCRIPTION:Most people know that you can have your ashes launched into sp
 ace\, or made into a diamond once you’ve been cremated\, but being crema
 ted is far from your only option. From alkaline hydrolysis to freeze-dryin
 g\, there are many (legal) ways to dispose of a body. Whether you want to 
 nourish fungi\, roses\, a coral reef or the minds of trainee doctors\, you
 r remains could make the world a better place. Why be scattered\, when you
  can leave behind something way more interesting?\n\nThis session will loo
 k at what actually happens in a crematorium and a burial (both traditional
  and green) as well as some of the more unusual alternatives that are now 
 available to dispose of a body and the controversies that surround them.\n
 \nPlease note: if you just can’t live with your spouse any more\, or you
  have a life-long vendetta against someone\, this session won’t help you
  get that sorted out. Seek counselling. Buy a pet. Get out more. But don
 ’t kill them.\n\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/141

DESCRIPTION:I've designed a series of PCB modules that can be wired in ser

 through-hole components – including LEDs\, resistors\, coin battery hold

  decorative (such as LED diffusers)\, and I plan to expand with more.\nThe
  PCBs also include strain-relief features\; they are connected with wires 
 to form "ropes" of circuitry\, supported by a braided hemp sheath.\n\nThe 
 project expands on a current trend in approachable tech: enabling people t
 o build circuits with crafts such as stickers (Chibitronics)\, painting (B
 are Conductive)\, and Lego (Crazy Circuits / Leguino). I want to do the sa
 me with jewelry-making.\n\nI'll have some prototypes and demos\, and I'd l

DESCRIPTION:HiTag2 is an RFID technology operating at 125KHz. It is distin
 guished from many others in the same field by its use of 2-way communicati
 ons for authentication and its use of encryption to protect the data trans
 missions - the majority of RFID technologies at 125KHz feature no authenti
 cation or encryption at all. As a result it has been widely used to provid
 e secure building access and has also been used as the technology that imp
 lements car immobilisers.\n\nIn 2012\, academic researchers Roel Verdult\,
  Flavio D. Garcia and Josep Balasch published the seminal paper\, ‘Gone 
 in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2’ that presented three attacks on t
 he encryption system used in HiTag2. They implemented their attacks on the
  Proxmark 3 device (an RFID research and hacking tool) and gave several hi
 gh-profile demonstrations\, but didn’t release any of their code or tool
 s. Since then\, the forums supporting Proxmark 3 and RFIDler (another RFID
  hacking tool) have received many requests for implementations of these at
 tacks\, but until recently none had been forthcoming. Garcia et al went on
  to produce a fast correlation attack in the 2016 paper\, ‘Lock It and S
 till Lose It’.\n\nIn this talk I will explain how HiTag2 RFID works in d
 etail\, including the PRNG and the authentication and encryption protocols
 \, and will present my own implementations of the attacks\, written for RF
 IDler and supported by desktop computers. The first attack uses a nonce re
 play to misuse the integrity protection of the comms in order to allow acc
 ess to the readable RFID tag pages without needing to know the key. The se
 cond\, third and fourth attacks use time/memory trade-off brute force\, cr
 yptanalytic attacks and a fast correlation attack to recover the key\, suc
 h that the contents of the read-protected pages can also be accessed. The 
 attacks are weaponised and permit cloning of tags\, which I will demonstra
 te.\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/73

DESCRIPTION:This workshop will take attendees through converting pound sho
 p battery powered LED light strings to solar power\, using the innards fro
 m pound shop solar garden lights. The finished item can be decorated by ad
 ding little handmade paper/card lanterns to cover the LEDs\, which attende
 es can also make on the day (templates provided). \n\nA little soldering i
 s required\, as is an average level of manual dexterity. \n\nIf you feel l
 ike brightening up the house\, tent\, garden\, or even yourself with some 
 lovely LEDs\, this little project is definitely for you :) \nAttending thi
 s workshop will cost     £3 per person (LED string\, solar light\, heatsh
 rink\, wire possibly\, glue possibly)\nSuitable age range     probably adu
 lt or older responsible supervised child\nAttendees should bring     some 
 experience of basic soldering would help a bit\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp

DESCRIPTION:\nTHIS WORKSHOP HAS BEEN CANCELED! (blame Ukrainian post)\nSor
 ry!\n\n\n\n\nRadioactivity is as fascinating as it is frightening because 
 humans cannot sense it\, and it can be dangerous in high doses. In this wo
 rkshop\, Yannick Verbelen from the University of Bristol introduces radioa
 ctivity and ionizing radiation detection principles on a level suitable fo
 r all ages. After a brief introduction\, participants build their own radi
 ation detector based on a Soviet era SBM-20 Geiger-Müller tube\, and test
  it by measuring various radioactive materials. Basic soldering skills and
  understanding of electronics are recommended but not necessary. Following
  this workshop does not guarantee mutations\, superpowers\, or survival. C
 hildren younger than 12 should be accompanied by adults.\n\nTHIS WORKSHOP

DESCRIPTION:I'm a wheelchair user that was unhappy with how wheelchair acc
 essories are expensive\, boring\, clinical\, and not fit for purpose. My p
 artner and I built some custom wheelchair accessories together and modifie
 d existing products for our own use\, and would like to teach others to do
  the same. We think that people with additional requirements should have t
 he same access to technology as everyone else and people in wheelchairs an
 d users of accessibility equipment should be seen and be seen with. We wan
 t accessible designs to be modern\, funky and useful.\n\nThe accessible pi
 xel modules are programmable coloured LED strips used as indicators\, illu
 mination\, and decoration of a wheelchair\, accessibility accessory\, back
 pack or anything you might think of. powered with a 5 volt powerbank and c
 onnected to a convenient control panel. They are designed to adapt to a us
 er’s needs.\n\nThis is a workshop for other wheelchair users and their f
 riends where they have the opportunity to make their own accessible pixel 
 modules and also design and build their own accessories. We will bring kit
 s for people to purchase and build their first accessible pixel module and
  provide a list of parts should they wish to build more on their own. We w
 ill also have parts and tools available for prototyping other accessories.
  We will show the basics of writing code for Arduino and how to create a f
 inished product adapted to your needs. We will also cover basic soldering 
 techniques and open a discussion around what other people with additional 
 requirements need and how they can solve their own problems by creating te
 chnology.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost     £20 per kit (10 Spaces
  Available)\nSuitable age range     Any\, but with parents if under 13\nAt
 tendees should bring     Laptop (preferable)\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.o

DESCRIPTION:Modern electronic components tend to only come in surface moun
 t\, but most people interested in doing electronics as a hobby seem to be 
 afraid of those. This is a workshop designed to remove your fear of workin
 g with (soldering\, reworking) surface mount components. You will go throu
 gh a scaled-down and de-automated version of the industrial electronics as
 sembly process\, including solder paste application\, pick and place (with
  tweezers)\, reflow (on a hotplate)\, inspection (visual)\, testing (elect
 ric and functional) and rework. In the end\, you will have assembled a wor
 king DC/DC converter board using minimal equipment and skills you didn't k
 now you had. So far\, every participant has discovered they can successful
 ly place 0402 passives and 0.5mm pitch QFNs with no issues. No prior knowl
 edge or skills required. This workshop is suitable for people who have nev
 er done anything with electronics before.\n\nThis workshop will cost: 20GB

 it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as 
 well.\n\nThis workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you n
 eed to know to get going on an Arduino.\n\nTaught by Mitch Altman. Partici
 pants will make their own Arduino clone\, and set it up on solderless brea
 dboards to make their own TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in publ
 ic places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics. Bring yo
 ur laptop\, if you can. \n\nWho: Anyone and everyone can have fun learning
  Arduino. Ages 10 to 100\n     Max #: 50 participants -- This workshop wil

 oratory has been ransacked\, her PhD students are accusing each other of m
 urder\, and something is watching from the other side of the Dreamcatcher.
 ..\n\nProfessor Alia Gold had a dream: to build the world's first truly im
 aginative machine. But for reasons unknown\, just before her death\, she s
 plit her research into ten fragments and hid them all around the EMF camps

 her death... but watch out. Nothing is as it seems\, and your choices may 
 affect the very course of human history. \n\n===========================\n

SUMMARY:Sense without sight - TALK

UID:-305
DESCRIPTION:Learn what it's like to see the world without using your eyes.
 \n\nThis is from a blind perspective\, but not solely. The vast majority o
 f the cues discussed are sensory input that you already have\, and you sim
 ply don’t realize or pay attention to. \n\nHopefully you'll come away fr
 om the talk not just more informed about what walking around actually is l
 ike for blind people\, but with a noticeable qualitative improvement in ho
 w you perceive the world around you.\n\nThis will also (briefly) cover how
  and how not to interact with a blind person on the street\, cognitive shi
 fts from perceiving the world as a blind person\, real vs myth difficultie
 s\, etc.\n\nThis talk is specifically focused on navigation and sensory ex
 perience. It won't cover Braille\, computers\, general life skills\, medic
 al/legal issues\, or the like.\n\n\nThe talk will try to cover as much as 
 can be done without direct experience.\n\nHowever\, there's a huge qualita
 tive difference between simply hearing me talk about it (or show you)\, an
 d experiencing it for yourself.  \n\n\nTherefore\, I am also running hands
 -on\, 1-hour workshops (2 per day). \n\nWorkshop participants will be blin
 dfolded\, given a guide cane\, and led through a crash course in how to us
 e and perceive the cues that are discussed in the talk\, and an additional
  Q&A / debriefing session afterwards. This starts from simply walking para
 llel to a road\, and quickly escalates to hearing corridors\, feeling wall
 s at a (short) distance\, etc.\n\n\nIf you're interested\, please fill out
  the form: https://s.ai/emf/ws\n\nLink: http://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/201
