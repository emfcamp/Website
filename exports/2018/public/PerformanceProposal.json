She rejoices in her discovery, until Other Mother and the rest of her parallel family try to keep her there forever. Coraline must use all her resources and bravery to make it back to her own family and life.\r\n\r\nThis beautifully animated piece takes Neil Gaiman\u2019s source material and spins it into a fun and sometimes creepy fairy tale. Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) creates a series of stop-motion set pieces that equally bewilder and delight. A delicious alternative to saccharine-sweet Hollywood standards.\r\n\r\nMay be unsuitable for younger children.",

                "published_description": "Continuing in the tradition of sonic-fiction, POLYOP fuse live electronic music performance with sci-fi mythologies to create an immersive audio-visual voyage. Follow the omnipotent Creator on his pilgrimage through distant reaches of an alternate polyhedral universe, occupied by psychedelic soundscapes, rhythmical acid entities and uncharted electro artefacts. \r\n\r\nPOLYOP have developed their live show alongside their own open-source visual performance engine 'Hedron'. Their sound fuses the DNA of funk, and electro with techno and modern sound design; whilst the visuals combine sci-fi aesthetics with polyhedral graphics popularised by early 3D graphics engines.\r\n\r\nVids & Projects: \r\nhttp://polyop.uk/",
