            "description": "\nArduino is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use. It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes. Yet, it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as well.\n\nThis workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.\n\nTaught by Mitch Altman. Participants will make their own Arduino clone, and set it up on solderless breadboards to make their own TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics. Bring your laptop, if you can. \n\nWho: Anyone and everyone can have fun learning Arduino. Ages 10 to 100\n     Max #: 50 participants -- This workshop will fill up, so please arrive early!\n           -- No need to register -- just show up early and get a kit to take the workshop\n     Cost: \u00a330 for materials -- includes everything you need to make your Arduino TV-B-Gone (and to play and experiment at home)!\n          And you get to bring your Arduino TV-B-Gone home with you.\n\nMore info: https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/ArduinoForTotalNewbies",

My partner and I built some custom wheelchair accessories together and modified existing products for our own use, and would like to teach others to do the same. We think that people with additional requirements should have the same access to technology as everyone else and people in wheelchairs and users of accessibility equipment should be seen and be seen with. We want accessible designs to be modern, funky and useful.\n\nThe accessible pixel modules are programmable coloured LED strips used as indicators, illumination, and decoration of a wheelchair, accessibility accessory, backpack or anything you might think of. powered with a 5 volt powerbank and connected to a convenient control panel. They are designed to adapt to a user\u2019s needs.\n\nThis is a workshop for other wheelchair users and their friends where they have the opportunity to make their own accessible pixel modules and also design and build their own accessories. We will bring kits for people to purchase and build their first accessible pixel module and provide a list of parts should they wish to build more on their own. We will also have parts and tools available for prototyping other accessories. We will show the basics of writing code for Arduino and how to create a finished product adapted to your needs. We will also cover basic soldering techniques and open a discussion around what other people with additional requirements need and how they can solve their own problems by creating technology.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost     \u00a320 per kit (10 Spaces Available)\nSuitable age range     Any, but with parents if under 13\nAttendees should bring     Laptop (preferable)",

The vast majority of the cues discussed are sensory input that you already have, and you simply don\u2019t realize or pay attention to. \n\nHopefully you'll come away from the talk not just more informed about what walking around actually is like for blind people, but with a noticeable qualitative improvement in how you perceive the world around you.\n\nThis will also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind person on the street, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind person, real vs myth difficulties, etc.\n\nThis talk is specifically focused on navigation and sensory experience. It won't cover Braille, computers, general life skills, medical/legal issues, or the like.\n\n\nThe talk will try to cover as much as can be done without direct experience.\n\nHowever, there's a huge qualitative difference between simply hearing me talk about it (or show you), and experiencing it for yourself.  \n\n\nTherefore, I am also running hands-on, 1-hour workshops (2 per day). \n\nWorkshop participants will be blindfolded, given a guide cane, and led through a crash course in how to use and perceive the cues that are discussed in the talk, and an additional Q&A / debriefing session afterwards. This starts from simply walking parallel to a road, and quickly escalates to hearing corridors, feeling walls at a (short) distance, etc.\n\n\nIf you're interested, please fill out the form: https://s.ai/emf/ws",

We'll be running from Friday 8pm until Sunday 3pm. The hunt will take 1 - 3 hours if done all at once, but can be completed at your leisure.\n\n\nSurely there's some kind of story?\n===========================\nThe Professor is dead, her laboratory has been ransacked, her PhD students are accusing each other of murder, and something is watching from the other side of the Dreamcatcher...\n\nProfessor Alia Gold had a dream: to build the world's first truly imaginative machine. But for reasons unknown, just before her death, she split her research into ten fragments and hid them all around the EMF campsite.\n\nYour quest: to retrieve all ten shards - and solve the mystery of her death... but watch out. Nothing is as it seems, and your choices may affect the very course of human history. \n\n===========================\n\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttps://dreamcatcherpuzzle.xyz \n\n\nContact us at:\n\ndreamcatcher.puzzle@gmail.com\nor talk to us -- we're in the tent with the flamingo on top, near the quiet area (a bit east of our location on the map.)",
