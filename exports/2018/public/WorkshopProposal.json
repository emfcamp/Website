Ultimately pushing them to better secure their services and thus protecting your privacy.\r\n\r\nAfter a short introduction you'll be surfing the web, finding names, addresses and urls of the UK government and adding them to the map. They will automatically be scanned for basic security. If all is well, they are shown green, otherwise orange or red. Expect a lot of red.\r\n\r\nThe results of our work will be sent to various press agencies in the UK. We hope they start asking questions about the sad state of security. This causes responsible organizations to wake up and adopt better practices, securing your data and privacy. We've seen this work in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nYou can expect: It's a lot of fun to see the amount of data grow, and more terribleness appear. Club Mate will be provided. The hunt is on!\r\n\r\nRequirements: This workshop is suitable for anyone with basic computer knowledge. Bring your own laptop / tablet / smartphone.\r\n\r\nAll data gathered is published publicly in easy to consume formats. The software running this is fully open source and available on gitlab.

After running the first program, your team will be able to make changes to the CPU's arrangement and operation to optimise yourselves.

Things like ARIA and tab order logic can also be intimidating and may lead developers to make experiences worse when they think they are improving it.\r\n \r\nThis workshop will be part-talk, part-practical, to demystify accessibility: why it matters, what are the things to consider, how to test and find issues, and most importantly what you can do to fix them. Participants will have hands-on exercises of using a screen reader on their own devices, navigating using just a keyboard, and identify what's a good and a terrible experience.

We'll begin with a short introduction, which will also cover a safety briefing (always avoid capacitors) and some top tips e.g Do not bend anything that you are dearly attached to, or is difficult to replace. Usually circuit bending does not harm your targets, but sometimes things go wrong and you might accidentally fry the piece you are working on.\r\n\r\nAfter everybody has the chance to find the noises within the toy we'll all connect up to the PA system and get everybody jamming together - collaborating through music and digital creativity.",
