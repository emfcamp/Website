The youngest children could then decorate their wand with natural resources, (or I could provide some coloured string, ribbon, feathers etc).  The older children could use basic woodcrafting tools such as potato peelers to strip the wands and whiltting knives to add carving notches for decoration, in addition.   I would imagine the younger children finishing earlier, but for older children this taking about an hour.  I would prefer all children to be accompanied by an adult, especially if they are hoping to use the tools.  I am a teacher, so CRB checked and Level 3 Qualified Forest School Leader.",
