Very much a work in progress, so exactly how it will respond to people is constantly evolving - what will it make of you?  Will it try to follow you, run away or give you a wink?\r\n\r\nDesigned and built by 17 year old Lead Roboteer of RobotMad this project is his first venture into larger scale robotics previously having cut his teeth on Antweight fighting robots.",

Bring them to EMF Camp and turn them into haute couture with our straightforward T-shirt hacks. We\u2019ll provide sewing machines, some basic supplies, and a variety of designs. You bring your T-shirts and your imagination. We have some no-sew designs that simply involve cutting and tying, some intermediate designs that involve a bit of straight sewing on a sewing machine, and some complex designs that combine more than one shirt into a single, final masterpiece. The workshop is held in a drop-in format: stop by when you have some time (minimum 30 minutes, complex designs might take an hour). The projects are suitable for adults, teens, and older children with some adult help.\r\n\r\nNo-sew hacks you can try: Infinity Scarf, Fringed Scarf, Knotted Scarf, T-Shirt Yarn, Bracelet made from T-Shirt yarn.\r\n\r\nMinimal Sewing Hacks: Beanie hat, Convertible neck warmer/hat, Wrist warmers\r\n\r\nIntermediate Sewing Hacks: Laptop sleeve, Cushion Covers",

We will aim to run it 24/7 throughout the weekend.\r\n\r\nFor more information, get in touch or go to https://swansea.hackspace.org.uk/Main/Projects\r\n\r\nWe can put on the display without funding, but some extra money will allow us to create a more professional exhibition with full Swansea Hackspace and EMF branding!",
