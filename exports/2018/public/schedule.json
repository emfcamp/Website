A bioarchaeologist and an applied philosopher will take you on a historical zombie adventure beyond Romero's shambling hordes and stories about Haitian Voodoo. Did you know that the D&D wondrous item: Hand of Glory was inspired by real artefacts? Or that miasmic \"zombification\" in some video games reflects medieval ideas about contagion? What do past ideas about zombies tell us about zombies now? And how do video game zombies reflect current ideas about ethics? Also, find out how zombies play a role in cutting-edge neuroscience and ICT research!",

A gyro was \u00a3160 back then, a 3 axis IMU is now about \u00a35, how things have changed.\r\n\r\nSince then I have built one and two wheeled boards, 2 wheeled wheelchair prototype and many others, documented on YT and Instructables, long before such gadgets came out from China, culminating in a 3000W hubmotor 1 wheeled motorcycle which I plan to bring to the camp and demonstrate. I test these on Pembrey and the famous Pendine Sands beaches in Wales, with video clips I can present.\r\n\r\nImposter credentials: I am a hospital doctor not an engineer. Electronic hobbyist. Until I started this sequence of machines I had only coded in BASIC aged 14 on my Sinclair ZX81 (built from a kit obviously).",

Ultimately pushing them to better secure their services and thus protecting your privacy.\r\n\r\nAfter a short introduction you'll be surfing the web, finding names, addresses and urls of the UK government and adding them to the map. They will automatically be scanned for basic security. If all is well, they are shown green, otherwise orange or red. Expect a lot of red.\r\n\r\nThe results of our work will be sent to various press agencies in the UK. We hope they start asking questions about the sad state of security. This causes responsible organizations to wake up and adopt better practices, securing your data and privacy. We've seen this work in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nYou can expect: It's a lot of fun to see the amount of data grow, and more terribleness appear. Club Mate will be provided. The hunt is on!\r\n\r\nRequirements: This workshop is suitable for anyone with basic computer knowledge. Bring your own laptop / tablet / smartphone.\r\n\r\nAll data gathered is published publicly in easy to consume formats. The software running this is fully open source and available on gitlab. You can see an example of the Netherlands: https://faalkaart.nl.",

In this workshop, all the participants will be able to be part of a giant micro:bit - teams will race against each other to run different programs, each attendee being a part of the machine. There\u2019ll be a small workshop at the beginning and the end so that we demystify the way computers work and understand what we're all doing.\r\n\r\nThis is a good companion to other programming workshops because it turns the concept on its head, with the participants running, not writing, programs.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just about *being* a CPU though, our aim is to optimise one. After running the first program, your team will be able to make changes to the CPU's arrangement and operation to optimise yourselves. If you've ever asked yourself \"what does it mean to be part of a 5-stage pipeline?\" or thought \"Can I try branch prediction today?\" then this is definitely the workshop for you. If you don't know what those things are, then this is the place to learn what it means and have some fun.",

The speaker highly recommends none of this is applied in the real world. It would definitely not be a good idea. Please don't.

We\u2019re professionalising and expanding our abilities, but in doing so we\u2019re encountering dramatic new risks and venturing into new ethical territory. In this way, we share similarities with the expansion of traditional civil engineering during the industrial revolution. In this talk I\u2019ll discuss what lessons can we learn from that industry, and how we can try to avoid making some of the same mistakes. I\u2019ll also give a basic introduction to engineering ethics, discuss some examples of ethical problems from my own career, and explore how we can try to improve our ethical decision-making by incorporating ethical reasoning into the different stages of our work.",

What will the future hold for the human body and communication when we boldly go into space? What ethical consideration must we take to ensure that it is the many who control their personal data?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been making educational, technologically exciting ballets and performance workshops for five years now. As artists we want to do collaborative learning with our audiences, to help them express their own ideas within a collaborative artistic technological framework. It is not just a performance to sit down and watch. Art and performance can break down the traditional barriers to audiences that consider themselves non-technical. We like to release as much of our performance and learning materials as possible as open source.\r\n\r\nOur project is long-running, and has tackled subjects from chronic pain to sorting algorithms. Now we are looking to space, brain hacking, and unashamed futurism. How can we begin to live in the future while increasing accessibility and inclusivity? What are the ethical concerns surrounding things that might seem abstract at first glance - like brainwave data?\r\n\r\nClassical ballet might sound like a strange way to learn about technology, ethics and medicine, but we hope to change the way you think about education/learning. Combining the algorithmic nature of classical ballet with futuristic thinking, breaking down artificial cultural barriers and fostering personal creative ownership for all. \r\n\r\nMay contain duct tape.",

    "description": "Spider silk is the strongest natural fibre known to man - stronger than steel, tougher than Kevlar, spider silks act as natural glues, cements, elastic capture webs and physical gills, all to enable spiders to survive and hunt on 6 out of 7 continents on Earth (the exception being icy Antarctica). \r\n\r\nI've spent the last 4 years researching spider silk at the University of Nottingham, learning how spiders have spent the last 386 million years adapting their silk to perform in a massive range of tasks. But now, scientists and industry professionals are looking into how we can adapt spider silk for our own purposes. Want a giant net that can catch falling Jumbos? We're on it. How about a biocompatible silk scaffold to help regrow that broken bone? We're on that too. \r\n\r\nThis is a 30 minute talk on the subject of spider silk aimed at those with an interest in, but no specialist knowledge of, science. There will be some pictures of spiders at the start but should otherwise be friendly for those who are interested but wary of things with eight legs. ",

But to keep such an ambitious project manageable I had to create structure and tools around how I approached getting started and continuing to develop, and find ways to keep myself motivated in the days when it all goes wrong.

The platform also had to be able to extract key facts about the underlying events mentioned in the articles.\r\n\r\nI would like share the story of how our team, that had never met in person, put together a platform using almost 100% open source tools, and ultimately won the competition. We were subsequently invited to Geneva to help implement our platform, and we presented it to the broader non-profit community at an event at the International Red Cross museum.\r\n\r\nDuring my talk the areas I would like to address are:\r\n1. My experience of learning & getting involved in data science/programming/machine learning as a non-professional programmer\r\n2. What it was like to work on something constructive with a team from around the world that had never met each other\r\n3.

Scientists think that Dark Matter is everywhere, streaming through you as you read this right now!

No previous knowledge of Lua or game development required :D\r\n\r\n**If you want to get a jump start on things before the workshop, please download Unity, Steam, and have a read of 'Getting Started with Levelkit' on our wiki:. http://wiki.offgridthegame.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_the_LevelKit\r\n\r\nYou can watch the 2016 EMF talk here:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=suEXrMO6rQo#\r\n\r\nRead what Eurogamer has to say about Off Grid here:  https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-15-off-grid-is-about-the-principles-of-hacking\r\n",

It is easy to forget that apps, data and connected systems need maintenance too, if they are to realise their potential and be useful or fun for more than a brief moment. \r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not always easy. It can be hard to find good resourcing models for long-lasting products, or for looking after new forms of shared infrastructure (such as open source software libraries). Strong commons models, where groups share and steward resources (whether the knowledge in Wikipedia or open hardware designs) are scarce or difficult to replicate. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll talk about maintenance, good and bad examples of it, and what we are doing to recognise the work done in repair, custodianship, stewardship, tending and caring for things that matter.  \r\n",

It\u2019s likely that the first few groups won\u2019t take too long, and if they stick around to watch further groups they\u2019ll learn more ways of getting to the end. \r\n\r\nIt will be fun for novice and veteran D&D players, but likely not beginners.\r\n\r\nIt is thoroughly recommended that you bring some good time spirits, as crowd participation will be encouraged.

How to tweak your spinning to make yarns suitable for different purpose, and how to finish your yarns ready for use. We'll also cover the different kinds of plant and animal fibres, and their properties in spinning. There will be an oppourtunity to see a variety of different fibres, but wool will be the only fibre availiable to work with, as it is by far the simplest for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe kit is yours to take home, and includes 100g of wool fibre.

We're using mobile mapping technologies to make better maps of the country for our network planners.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll provide an overview of Mobile Mapping technologies, precision location (and the technology to achieve it), and share some open source workflows and tools for LiDAR data. I'll also talk a little about running a large-scale survey project, and some interesting challenges we've faced in both capture and data management.",

Using tractor beams, levitation pods (for polystyrene beads) and other demos, I will guide the audience towards a (not-so-far) future where what we see in science fiction movies like Iron Man or Minority Report is real. A world where two people will be able to listen at two different programs from the same radio or to receive personalised sound messages without headphones.

As of Aug 2018 Matrix has around 5.5M reachable users and over 8000 server instances, ranging from individual personal servers through to massive deployments for governments and telcos - and a huge community of open source contributors building alternative clients, bots,  bridges, servers etc.\r\n\r\nToday Matrix is in late beta, but as of the end of 2017 the protocol is feature frozen as we converge on a 1.0 release later in 2018.  In this talk we'll give an overview of the Matrix protocol, the ecosystem, the road to 1.0 and show off all the latest clients and capabilities - including some of the more exciting non-IM usages, such as VR communication!",

    "description": "Failure is a great teacher, but we do not often talk openly about failure in a public setting. As a scientist (and failure enthusiast), I am trying to encourage my community to talk more about failure, which is difficult since the path to success is to publish about successes and to hide failures. Let's do more to talk about failure as a Maker community. Let's be honest about the dead-ends and dumb mistakes that got us to that early prototype. Rather than ridiculing 'fails', let's instead celebrate them, since they're what we learn from and allows us to become better than we are.\r\n\r\nInstead of teaching people that failure is bad, let's teach them how to be resilient to failure - give them a safe space to fail in, and provide them the encouragement to keep working towards success. \r\n\r\nAs a social experiment, I will setup a slackline at EMF Camp and invite you to come and try to slackline for the first time and *livestream you failure* with the tag #EMFailure.

    "description": "Often we use graphs and charts ('visualizations') to display information in a way which makes understanding the data they show seem intuitive. They are used by well dressed individuals to show their projected quarterly earnings, by primary school teachers introducing exciting new ideas to wide eyed children, and by news organisations trying to explain that it's definitely ok to drink that 5th cup of coffee. But all's not fair in charts and graphs, intentionally or not they are not always faithful to the data. How can you spot a misleading chart, and what happens when what they don't reflect the truth? \r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll tour the visualization jungles, looking at some of the scariest, most dangerous, and weirdest visualizations out there. You'll learn some of the tricks used to change what a visualization shows and see examples of some previous weird and wonderful visualizations. By the end of our tour you'll know what to watch out for in your future visualization adventures, and how to make you own visualizations a little less intimidating or misleading to fellow adventurers.",

    "title": "Numbers vs Resources: The History of Banking",
    "description": "Tagline: \"I almost wish there were a conspiracy, but I'm afraid it's much worse than that.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a widely, but vaguely, appreciated fact that banks and banking are powerful and important aspects of modern history, which affect almost all aspects of politics and society. Most thoughtful people, reflecting on the present trajectory of history, get the uncomfortable feeling that we are all being driven toward economic, political and ecological disaster, and that international banking has something to do with it.\r\n\r\nThis has made banking the focus of numerous conspiracy theories, most of which contain useful and verifiable information, but all of which fail in one key respect: they all subordinate the banking system to the agency of secretive groups of people who supposedly control the whole system across generations.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy scenario, bad as it is, holds out the comforting thought that if we could just identify and take out the shadowy figures who are really in control, then everything could be put right. But what if the truth is even more terrible? What if the system has its own internal logic, like a virus or an algorithm, which needs no human hand to guide it?\r\n\r\nThis talk goes back to the basic principles, and the medieval Italian and English origins, of the banking system to explore its algorithmic properties. I will argue that credit systems are not only a powerful tool in the hands of human and organizations like governments and corporations, but also that they have revolutionary effects on the priorities and and agendas of those organizations. That the tool, in other words - like Elric of Melnibone's 'Stormbringer' or Faust's 'Mephistopheles' - guides the hand that seek to wield it.",

    "description": "How do people with disabilities use the internet? Accessibility and inclusive design have gained popularity recently, but a lot of web developers are still unaware of what they can do to make their sites and apps work for everyone. Even with a lot of goodwill, practical knowledge is needed: it can be overwhelming to try to use a screen reader, use the internet without a mouse, get notifications with no audio or empathise with reading and cognitive impairments. Things like ARIA and tab order logic can also be intimidating and may lead developers to make experiences worse when they think they are improving it.\r\n \r\nThis workshop will be part-talk, part-practical, to demystify accessibility: why it matters, what are the things to consider, how to test and find issues, and most importantly what you can do to fix them. Participants will have hands-on exercises of using a screen reader on their own devices, navigating using just a keyboard, and identify what's a good and a terrible experience. We will work on hands-on exercises with HTML and JavaScript to fix custom components, understand the logic, and for more experienced developers we will cover ARIA components and building accessible custom elements like accordions and tab panels.",

The format of the sessions is a short talk about the engineering principles in bridge design. Then we split up into team and work together to make a bridge that spans 35cm.\r\nAfter an hour we all come together to test each bridge by hanging weights off its center. Each bridge is tested to destruction. The bridge that holds the most weight is the winner and they receive a small token prize. ",

Leap Seconds are our current best effort to bridge the widening gap between Atomic Time and the actual rotation of the Earth. But the addition of a leap second causes no-end of headaches for technology systems that often prefer to ignore it. In this talk I'd like to trace the history of Leap Seconds, how we deal with them and the ongoing debate about their future.",

In this talk I will go into what SAT and SMT solvers are, what kind of solvers are out there and give some practical examples in using them both to find, e.g. crack codes or bugs in systems. In particular, I will showcase some interesting use-cases of SAT solvers for cryptography, SMT solvers for puzzle-solving, and concolic execution (using SMT solvers) for automated bug-finding.\r\n\r\nMate Soos has been developing the CryptoMiniSat SAT solver for over 7 years that has is used in many places both in academia and industry and he helps maintain the SMT solver STP that is widely used in both industry and research.

    "description": "When I learned the news that I had somewhat accidentally become the owner of a Decommissioned, 12 Storey High, Late Soviet Era, Water Tower in Latvia: naturally my first question was 'Could I use it to prop up a Buran?' (The USSR's equivalent of the US Space Shuttle)...  and If I'd have asked that question to Woking District council, then I'm guessing the answer would be a list of regulations that would contravene - but in Latvia, the answer was 'Yes, it is your tower so you can do what you like with it...'\r\n\r\nAnd so I had a challenge to work out what could and should be done with the tower and in very British tradition a list of 101 Hacks for a Water Tower was started, which was very rapidly joined by a sister list of 101 Ways to Kill Yourself on Water Tower.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I share some of the journey of exploration into the wonderful world of Water Towers, Soviet Engineering, the Baltics, and a bit of family history. This takes us from the British Water Tower Appreciation Society to Siberia and the SS, whilst taking part in a documentary, getting involved in an Olympic bid, making music, setting up an amateur radio station, breaking records (and a drone) on the tower on the way and much more.\r\n\r\nThe talk is generally light hearted, with a balance of education and amusement.

Care has been taken to make the PCBs easy to assemble.\r\nDuring the workshop I would like to point out:\r\n-\tWhat is a PCB anyway?\r\n-\tSolder, why are there so many different types? What should I use?\r\n-\tSoldering best practices and handy tips i.e. how to apply heat and solder to a joint.\r\n-\tVariations in components and the distinctions between polarised and unpolarised parts.\r\n\r\nDuring the workshop I would like to have attendees assemble one easy kit and one intermediate kit. The easy kit is a classic noisemaker/synth circuit, the mini APC (Atari Punk Console) including a small speaker. \r\nThe intermediate kit, which most beginners can handle after soldering the mini APC is a simple 8 step sequencer. The sequencer is able to sequence the mini APC by way of control voltages and gate signals, if all goes well the tent would be filled with people making 8 step musical loops.",

It is easy to build -- designed for total beginners to learn to solder together.  It provides a very low cost, yet powerful, method for making music/sound/noise, and a fun way to learn Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for generating music/sound/noise. This talk will show beginners how the ArduTouch music synthesizer kit makes use of DSP to create its large diversity of music/sound/noise. Mitch will also explain how the touch keyboard works, as well as the cheap amplifier/speaker built into the board. The ArduTouch Arduino library works on any Arduino board and Mitch will demonstrate how to make use of this library to create your own unique synthesizers -- both by hacking some of the many examples it comes with, and by making use of its high-level functions. This talk will also include a demo of some of the music the ArduTouch can make, as well as some wonderful nasty noise!\r\n\r\nA workshop for soldering together ArduTouch music synthesizer kits will be held before the talk on Sunday at 1pm at the Hardware Hacking Area (Camp: G).",

    "description": "As a member of the team who brought WaveNet into production, I would like to give an insight into the technical challenges and the technology which powers Google's voice, and how this type of algorithms could be used to solve other interesting problems.\r\n\r\nWaveNet is a machine learning algorithm developed at (Google) DeepMind which was the first to obtain human-like quality of voice directly modeling waveforms. You can read more about it here: \r\n\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/ \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet\r\n\r\nSince the original paper was published, there has been several developments to substantially speed up audio generation (several order of magnitude) in order to put it into production, and it is now powering Google's assistant voice in several languages. See also: \r\n\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/ \r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/high-fidelity-speech-synthesis-wavenet/ \r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435\r\n\r\nNote that the technology is not limited to audio and can pretty much work with any signal, but this is so new that we're just scratching the surface of the potential applications.\r\n\r\nIn my talk I will be talking about the basic tech, what it took to get it into production and the more recent developments. I would also like to give a few suggestions and hints on how to reproduce these results: the latest version (WaveRNN) is rather simple to implement and yet very powerful.",

Even if you don't have any success stories, if your makerspace hasn't been able to spend much time on engagement, or if you're not even involved in makerspaces but are curious about technology engagement issues, you're welcome to come along!\r\n\r\nAfter EMF I\u2019ll turn the information crowdsourced during the workshop into a zine so that other makerspaces can benefit from this advice :)",

    "description": "A brief history of folklore and technology.\r\n\r\nAt EMF2016, I talked about numbers stations - mysterious, Cold War shortwave radio stations. After doing that talk, I realised that the thing that I find most interesting about the numbers stations is how they became an urban myth, a living legend of the networked age.\r\n\r\nFor EMF2018, I'll examine the intersections of technology and folklore. I'll have a look at examples of our old folklore and superstitions following us into the spaces created by new technologies, and I'll also be looking at new folk tales that arise from our technologies, from World War II gremlins to Slenderman and the new cults of AI and Big Data.",

Noted for picking locks, questioning authority, and unapologetic playing of bongos, the physics superstar also dabbled in life drawing and testified to the acceptability of sexwork in the community. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll mix comedy, physics and biographical details to explain why Feynman is famous (in a way suitable for people who haven't studied physics past school)  and also why we should beware of buying into his personality cult.

They were known as \u2018computers\u2019.\r\n\r\nThree women challenged the status quo, demanding recognition, authority and respect. Katherine Johnson rose through the ranks to become one of NASA\u2019s most respected mathematicians, Mary Jackson became the first qualified African-American female engineer in the USA and Dorothy Vaughan saw the coming of machine-based computers, becoming one of the world\u2019s leading experts on programming.\r\n\r\nThis incredible true story charts the rise of these formidable scientists against the odds. Even today they are yet to receive the recognition they deserve and Hidden Figures takes great strides in correcting this.",

They aim to give customers more choice, but still as consumers rather than makers. We will explore how makerspaces could adapt these tools for DIY clothes making and show some of the tools that are accessible now.\r\n\r\nUsing new technologies, you no longer need to be a specialist to design clothes and shoes that fit perfectly. We will bring examples, including 3D printed sandals, a shoe last and insole, laser cut fabric and 3D printed accessories.\r\n\r\nWe will also highlight textile related developments in makerspaces including the raspberry pi 3D body scanner scanner we helped design at BuildBrighton, and hope to inspire more people to get involved in shaping new DIY technology.\r\n\r\n",

There may be free pickles and almost certainly there will be spoilers (I would advise attendees to read Those Who Walk Away From Omelas as preparation: http://www.mccc.edu/pdf/eng102/Week%209/Text_LeGuin%20Ursula_Ones%20Who%20Walk%20Away%20From%20Omelas.pdf).",

It's often used to solve problems such as spam email detection, natural language translation, to find images matching certain search criteria, or to make music recommendations. This talk will turn the problem around and examine the extent to which neural networks can emulate human creativity. We'll start by thinking about what it means for an algorithmic system to be creative. Then through examples we'll look at how techniques in machine learning can be used to compose original music and generate art. During the talk, we'll see how changing the algorithms and modifying the inputs to the neural networks affect the music and art created. We'll conclude by discussing future directions in the field of computational creativity, and thinking about whether computers will ever be able to match human levels of performance in this area.",

Go behind the scenes with an ethicist and co-author of the Association of Computing Machinery's (ACM) new code of ethics that affects hundreds of thousands of computing professionals and get some answers to the following: What is a Code of Ethics? Why bother updating the old code, or having one at all? What's the code asking me to do, and why? How can I practically use the code? How did you decide whether something is good or bad, or whether something should be included in the code? What if my boss thinks codes of ethics are for losers? What if I work in the military/security/etc. domain? How is this code different from all the other codes out there? What happens if I break the Code of Ethics?\r\n\r\nBonus, time permitting (or talk to the speaker afterwards): Feel free to bring along an ethical dilemma and see how you might interpret it according to the new Code!",

Between his death and his discovery, he visited sideshows, hung out at Niagra Falls, rode on rollerskates, became a drug addict, and inspired the look of Skeletor from the He-Man cartoons and toys.\r\n\r\nWe'll get into Elmer's actual life, his adventures after his death, and where he's residing now.

The youngest children could then decorate their wand with natural resources, (or I could provide some coloured string, ribbon, feathers etc).  The older children could use basic woodcrafting tools such as potato peelers to strip the wands and whiltting knives to add carving notches for decoration, in addition.   I would imagine the younger children finishing earlier, but for older children this taking about an hour.  I would prefer all children to be accompanied by an adult, especially if they are hoping to use the tools.  I am a teacher, so CRB checked and Level 3 Qualified Forest School Leader.",

Exercises include drawing cylinders from several angles while being aware of the 3d shape of the object, using a custom grid to copy a sketch and doing several iterations of thumbnails to explore an idea for a drawing. All the while, feedback and suggestions are offered to the participants.\r\n\r\nThe end outcome is that participants gain more confidence in their drawing abilities, go deeper into drawing even simple forms and understand that the underlying process for drawing is not a magical fuzzy path, but consists of many sequential and \u2018deterministic\u2019 steps.",

    "description": "As with many young people interested in computing, I could never work out how a computer could turn 1's and 0's flowing through logic gates into what you see before you. You learn that this magic box can be programmed to do all sorts of amazing things, but are never really given the details as to how it does it. I wanted to know more, and after some research I started making logic gates with the one bit of electronics I knew how to use: Electric relays. I scrounged parts from cars, microwaves, scrap change machines, etc and put them together into increasingly complex contraptions. Two years later, I had TIM 8: a fully programmable 8 bit relay computer. This is the story of how TIM 8 came about, what I learnt along the way, and how relay computers are a fantastic way to demonstrate how a computer really works.\r\n\r\nFor the talk I would bring a presentation and TIM 8 (the size of a small suitcase).",

An algorithm is more consistent and less prone to error of judgement. Yet a human can look you in the eye before passing sentence.\r\n\r\nYou need a liver transplant to save your life.

The technologies that phpBB was built on were quite simple, so the main focus of the talk will be the process of penetration testing.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics covered will include sanitising user input, as well as enforcing file and variable scopes. You will familiarise yourself with concepts such as never trusting user input and get to see exploits such as cross-site scripting and remote code execution.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will wrap up by patching out these vulnerabilities and hopefully learn a thing or two about building more secure software.",

Expanding to a live three-piece including sound engineer Stephen Dorphin and VJ Adrian Brian Thompson, their sound is inspired heavily by the 70s and 80s European art electronica pioneers (Jarre, Moroder, Kraftwerk), combined with the more recent influences of contemporary synthpop artists (Royksopp, Justice) as well as infusing aspects of dance, post-rock and ambient music.\r\n\r\nThe VIEON live show is a complete audio-visual event, using not only banks of synthesizers and samplers but also unusual visual instrumentation including vocoder, keytar, theremin and live projected technology and science-fiction inspired visuals including live webcam feeds of what's happening onstage.\r\n\r\nVIEON have raised their profile dramatically throughout 2015-17 with a series of engaging live audio-visual shows famed for their ambitious scope across the UK and beyond, playing their first overseas gig to a rapturous reception in Copenhagen in September 2017.",

    "description": "There are a number of emoji that, when used in digital communications, don't always refer to their original meaning. The peach emoji, for example, has been found through research conducted by emojipedia to refer most often not to the fruit, but to buttocks. Other fruit and vegetables emoji have suffered a similar fate.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explore the ways that emoji are frequently misunderstood or misused - referring to some of the leading research conducted by academics in the area. I will conclude with peer reviewed research that I have conducted looking at the ways we assign new meaning to emoji when communicating with a single other person. Why do we do this and how do we choose the emoji we use. Why is it that despite there being a heart emoji available, some of us choose to use \ud83c\udf55 to say \"I love you\"?\r\n\r\nThe set is presented in a stand up comedy-style and despite discussing academic research is very accessible to any range of audience.

So far, Podcasting has successfully resisted being sucked up by a single YouTube-style platform that looks helpful in the beginning but would set the rules of its community in the future.\r\n\r\nInstead Podcasting is very much alive and has proven to be able to create new and serve to existing communities, communicate effectively to its audience and establish a following other media types haven't seen yet. Podcasts are sexy and you really want to know why.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain in detail why podcasts matter, what makes podcasts magical when combined with community, why almost everybody should consider starting a podcast, which infrastructure on the net is actually useful, what kind of hardware is actually needed and what open source and free-ish tools exist to publish high quality audio content on the web today.",

    "description": "Most people know that you can have your ashes launched into space, or made into a diamond once you\u2019ve been cremated, but being cremated is far from your only option. From alkaline hydrolysis to freeze-drying, there are many (legal) ways to dispose of a body. Whether you want to nourish fungi, roses, a coral reef or the minds of trainee doctors, your remains could make the world a better place. Why be scattered, when you can leave behind something way more interesting?\r\n\r\nThis session will look at what actually happens in a crematorium and a burial (both traditional and green) as well as some of the more unusual alternatives that are now available to dispose of a body and the controversies that surround them.\r\n\r\nPlease note: if you just can\u2019t live with your spouse any more, or you have a life-long vendetta against someone, this session won\u2019t help you get that sorted out. Seek counselling. Buy a pet. Get out more. But don\u2019t kill them.\r\n",

I want to do the same with jewelry-making.\r\n\r\nI'll have some prototypes and demos, and I'd like to talk about how to use them, how they help me visualize the flow of electricity, and how to contribute. I'll also bring a few kits to give out! ",

The science section will cover topics from the anatomy to health, menstruation to menopause, contraception to consent, sexuality to gender identity. The culture collection will showcase the anatomy in the arts and their contribution to the discourse about our genitals, for example The Great Wall of Vagina or The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The society gallery will explore genitals\u2019 place in society, e.g. religious rites surrounding menstruation, the practises of FGM, of which over 200 million people are living today suffering from, sexual violence and how these cases are dealt with in court. The history gallery will contain objects relating to the history of gynaecological medicine, contraception, menstrual products and sex work.",

Well now it\u2019s the turn of smart materials.\r\n\r\nThis is a show about the future of stuff. Within our lifetimes, solid objects will react, sense, change and move according to their surroundings. This won\u2019t be a result of fancy robotics or cunning electronics, but rather the fundamental properties of the materials themselves. Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s flying machine, drawn over 500 year ago, smart materials will make our aeroplanes of the future adapting, sensing and morphing, so that they fly like birds or bats. In years to come, we will be living in self-regulating houses, riding self-fixing bicycles, and driving on self-illuminating roads, all thanks to smart materials. These are metals, plastics, fabrics and fluids that react to the outside world without any human involvement, and they promise to change the way we live our lives forever.\r\n\r\nIn this one hour show, an award-winning materials scientist and engineer will be your guide on the smart material safari. There will be demonstrations of the smart materials that exist today, and exploration on how they will make the material world around us smarter tomorrow. Expect to see matter doing things you\u2019ve never seen it do before!\r\n",

    "description": "HiTag2 is an RFID technology operating at 125KHz. It is distinguished from many others in the same field by its use of 2-way communications for authentication and its use of encryption to protect the data transmissions - the majority of RFID technologies at 125KHz feature no authentication or encryption at all. As a result it has been widely used to provide secure building access and has also been used as the technology that implements car immobilisers.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, academic researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio D. Garcia and Josep Balasch published the seminal paper, \u2018Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2\u2019 that presented three attacks on the encryption system used in HiTag2. They implemented their attacks on the Proxmark 3 device (an RFID research and hacking tool) and gave several high-profile demonstrations, but didn\u2019t release any of their code or tools. Since then, the forums supporting Proxmark 3 and RFIDler (another RFID hacking tool) have received many requests for implementations of these attacks, but until recently none had been forthcoming. Garcia et al went on to produce a fast correlation attack in the 2016 paper, \u2018Lock It and Still Lose It\u2019.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explain how HiTag2 RFID works in detail, including the PRNG and the authentication and encryption protocols, and will present my own implementations of the attacks, written for RFIDler and supported by desktop computers. The first attack uses a nonce replay to misuse the integrity protection of the comms in order to allow access to the readable RFID tag pages without needing to know the key. The second, third and fourth attacks use time/memory trade-off brute force, cryptanalytic attacks and a fast correlation attack to recover the key, such that the contents of the read-protected pages can also be accessed. The attacks are weaponised and permit cloning of tags, which I will demonstrate.",

Starting simply, with creating your own contact mics and spring reverbs, progressing all the way to creating your own midi controllers and fully programmable digital audio effects. The concept is to show you how easy it is to get started (I had no formal electronics background, and just learnt from experimenting) and inspire you to get started making NOISE.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover my personal journey through DIY instrument building, which I embarked on initially to build a simple item I needed for my live performance, and rapidly spiralled out of control!\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/sdTysy3dD84\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gib-URplJxI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xWpq3soblYY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/5j84GfI8yQM\r\n\r\nAbout the artist:\r\nCutlasses is the solo project of musician and DIY electronic instrument maker, Scott Pitkethly.  \r\n\r\nHe has given a number of of talks on the subject of DIY instrument building, as well as talks on other programming related subjects.  His electronic instruments won the Music Hackspace DIY Instrument award, and have featured on sites such as Hackaday and Create Digital Music. The homemade instruments combine both analogue and digital electronics to manipulate and deconstruct audio.\r\n",

My partner and I built some custom wheelchair accessories together and modified existing products for our own use, and would like to teach others to do the same. We think that people with additional requirements should have the same access to technology as everyone else and people in wheelchairs and users of accessibility equipment should be seen and be seen with. We want accessible designs to be modern, funky and useful.\n\nThe accessible pixel modules are programmable coloured LED strips used as indicators, illumination, and decoration of a wheelchair, accessibility accessory, backpack or anything you might think of. powered with a 5 volt powerbank and connected to a convenient control panel. They are designed to adapt to a user\u2019s needs.\n\nThis is a workshop for other wheelchair users and their friends where they have the opportunity to make their own accessible pixel modules and also design and build their own accessories. We will bring kits for people to purchase and build their first accessible pixel module and provide a list of parts should they wish to build more on their own. We will also have parts and tools available for prototyping other accessories. We will show the basics of writing code for Arduino and how to create a finished product adapted to your needs. We will also cover basic soldering techniques and open a discussion around what other people with additional requirements need and how they can solve their own problems by creating technology.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost     \u00a320 per kit (10 Spaces Available)\nSuitable age range     Any, but with parents if under 13\nAttendees should bring     Laptop (preferable)",

    "description": "Modern electronic components tend to only come in surface mount, but most people interested in doing electronics as a hobby seem to be afraid of those. This is a workshop designed to remove your fear of working with (soldering, reworking) surface mount components. You will go through a scaled-down and de-automated version of the industrial electronics assembly process, including solder paste application, pick and place (with tweezers), reflow (on a hotplate), inspection (visual), testing (electric and functional) and rework. In the end, you will have assembled a working DC/DC converter board using minimal equipment and skills you didn't know you had. So far, every participant has discovered they can successfully place 0402 passives and 0.5mm pitch QFNs with no issues. No prior knowledge or skills required. This workshop is suitable for people who have never done anything with electronics before.\n\nThis workshop will cost: 20GBP or 20EUR, whichever you prefer",

    "description": "\nArduino is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use. It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes. Yet, it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as well.\n\nThis workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.\n\nTaught by Mitch Altman. Participants will make their own Arduino clone, and set it up on solderless breadboards to make their own TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics. Bring your laptop, if you can. \n\nWho: Anyone and everyone can have fun learning Arduino. Ages 10 to 100\n     Max #: 50 participants -- This workshop will fill up, so please arrive early!\n           -- No need to register -- just show up early and get a kit to take the workshop\n     Cost: \u00a330 for materials -- includes everything you need to make your Arduino TV-B-Gone (and to play and experiment at home)!\n          And you get to bring your Arduino TV-B-Gone home with you.\n\nMore info: https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/ArduinoForTotalNewbies",

Think of it as a cross between a treasure hunt and an escape room.\n\n\nWhere?\n======\nWe are based in a shipping container in the Null Sector area of the campsite. \n\n\nWhen?\n=====\nYou can start at any time. We'll be running from Friday 8pm until Sunday 3pm. The hunt will take 1 - 3 hours if done all at once, but can be completed at your leisure.\n\n\nSurely there's some kind of story?\n===========================\nThe Professor is dead, her laboratory has been ransacked, her PhD students are accusing each other of murder, and something is watching from the other side of the Dreamcatcher...\n\nProfessor Alia Gold had a dream: to build the world's first truly imaginative machine. But for reasons unknown, just before her death, she split her research into ten fragments and hid them all around the EMF campsite.\n\nYour quest: to retrieve all ten shards - and solve the mystery of her death... but watch out. Nothing is as it seems, and your choices may affect the very course of human history. \n\n===========================\n\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttps://dreamcatcherpuzzle.xyz \n\n\nContact us at:\n\ndreamcatcher.puzzle@gmail.com\nor talk to us -- we're in the tent with the flamingo on top, near the quiet area (a bit east of our location on the map.)",

The vast majority of the cues discussed are sensory input that you already have, and you simply don\u2019t realize or pay attention to. \n\nHopefully you'll come away from the talk not just more informed about what walking around actually is like for blind people, but with a noticeable qualitative improvement in how you perceive the world around you.\n\nThis will also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind person on the street, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind person, real vs myth difficulties, etc.\n\nThis talk is specifically focused on navigation and sensory experience. It won't cover Braille, computers, general life skills, medical/legal issues, or the like.\n\n\nThe talk will try to cover as much as can be done without direct experience.\n\nHowever, there's a huge qualitative difference between simply hearing me talk about it (or show you), and experiencing it for yourself.  \n\n\nTherefore, I am also running hands-on, 1-hour workshops (2 per day). \n\nWorkshop participants will be blindfolded, given a guide cane, and led through a crash course in how to use and perceive the cues that are discussed in the talk, and an additional Q&A / debriefing session afterwards. This starts from simply walking parallel to a road, and quickly escalates to hearing corridors, feeling walls at a (short) distance, etc.\n\n\nIf you're interested, please fill out the form: https://s.ai/emf/ws",
