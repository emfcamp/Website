It uses web technologies and cheap, off the shelf hardware to give good quality audio and video, and also allows me to move around a bit. It's particularly good for small meetings where manifesting in a laptop or phone doesn't give me enough physical presence to participate fully. &#13;
&#13;
I'll run through the technologies involved, the advantages and pitfalls of using one, and some of the 10 experiments and mistakes that have culminated in its current format: an Ikea lamp. I'll also do a demo!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-456-a-cheap-remotely-posable-presence-robot-using-a-raspberry-pi</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="372">Libby Miller</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="18e9dac2-bb79-589b-8293-8ae965351023" id="229"><room>Stage A</room><title>101 Hacks for Late Soviet Water Towers</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T13:30:00+01:00</date><start>13:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>When I learned the news that I had somewhat accidentally become the owner of a Decommissioned, 12 Storey High, Late Soviet Era, Water Tower in Latvia: naturally my first question was 'Could I use it to prop up a Buran?' (The USSR's equivalent of the US Space Shuttle)...  and If I'd have asked that question to Woking District council, then I'm guessing the answer would be a list of regulations that would contravene - but in Latvia, the answer was 'Yes, it is your tower so you can do what you like with it...'&#13;
&#13;
And so I had a challenge to work out what could and should be done with the tower and in very British tradition a list of 101 Hacks for a Water Tower was started, which was very rapidly joined by a sister list of 101 Ways to Kill Yourself on Water Tower.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk I share some of the journey of exploration into the wonderful world of Water Towers, Soviet Engineering, the Baltics, and a bit of family history. This takes us from the British Water Tower Appreciation Society to Siberia and the SS, whilst taking part in a documentary, getting involved in an Olympic bid, making music, setting up an amateur radio station, breaking records (and a drone) on the tower on the way and much more.&#13;
&#13;
The talk is generally light hearted, with a balance of education and amusement. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-229-101-hacks-for-late-soviet-water-towers</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="134">Ben Fitzgerald</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="34ff3049-1626-5c37-8ac2-d814aece0240" id="145"><room>Stage A</room><title>Boiling Nemo - Make your own Internet of Things</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T14:10:00+01:00</date><start>14:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>In recent history, fish have been relatively untroubled by the Internet of Things, but it was time for that to change. Armed only with a soldering iron, a Raspberry Pi, some JavaScript and ideas above my station, I set about connecting my aquarium to the Internet. Soon, armed with delusions of grandeur, things inevitably spiralled about of control and now my garage door has an API.&#13;
&#13;
This talk is equal parts tutorial, inspiration and lunacy as I take the audience through my projects and hopefully dispel some of the mystery of IoT devices, showing how it can be easy to learn and a lot of fun to build.&#13;
&#13;
Highlights include a Scottish toilet emergency, an aquarium featuring military-grade security and an extinction-level event in the suburbs of Milton Keynes.&#13;

&#13;
The speaker will cover (at a very high level), train detection, train signalling across UK mainline and metro (tube) systems. As the UK mostly invented a lot of this stuff, it's applicable worldwide :)&#13;
&#13;
Come and be surprised how not-boring railways actually are (and how you could in theory implement a lot of it with arduinos and raspberry pis)!&#13;
&#13;
Includes stories such as 'You could basically still repeat the great train robbery today, here's how' and 'Can you stop trains with only an ISM band radio?'. The speaker highly recommends none of this is applied in the real world. It would definitely not be a good idea. Please don't. But it's nice to know some technical details at least.&#13;
&#13;
The speaker will assume no previous knowledge and the content is appropriate for all. It would mostly appeal to those who are interested in railways, transport and infrastructure. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-19-how-does-railway-signalling-work</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="9">Paul</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="d8ab3ee5-cd93-526b-aa7c-ccb5fdd6ec55" id="504"><room>Stage A</room><title>Dark-Dark Dark-Matter Matter-Matter</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T17:30:00+01:00</date><start>17:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Everything we see in the Universe makes up only a paltry 4% of the total sum. The rest is &#8216;dark&#8217; &#8211; we know remarkably little about it other than what we call &#8216;Dark Energy&#8217; is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, and &#8216;Dark Matter&#8217; is holding galaxies like our own Milky Way together. Scientists think that Dark Matter is everywhere, streaming through you as you read this right now! Understanding the nature of Dark Matter is one of the most important scientific missions of our time. In this talk, I will present what evidence we have for the existence of Dark Matter, what we know, and how we go about finding out more about it. Finally, I will entertain the idea of a Dark-Matter-inclusive universe and imagine what having access to such a resource  would imply for humanity. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-504-dark-dark-dark-matter-matter-matter</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1581">Nicolas Angelides</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="81ab442c-5085-5223-a036-89eaa8423ae0" id="223"><room>Stage A</room><title>Taming Terrain: Sculpting geoscapes from LiDAR</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T18:10:00+01:00</date><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Governments and organisations the world over are releasing free LiDAR data - capturing the globe in 3D down to the metre. But how can you take this data and make into something tangible? And how can you do it at both the small scale of cities and the enormous scale of mountain ranges?&#13;
&#13;
We'll look at three different methods of making 3D terrain models via both 3D printing and CNC machining - examining where the data comes from and LiDAR technology; the challenges of LiDAR data and how to shape it into 3D models; and how to take these highly detailed models and successfully print or machine them.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-223-taming-terrain-sculpting-geoscapes-from-lidar</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1216">Andrew Godwin</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="2ad7a334-13a3-55a7-aea1-97085646de85" id="131"><room>Stage A</room><title>Everything you never wanted to know about smart lightbulbs</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T18:50:00+01:00</date><start>18:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Smart connected lightbulbs are common, cheap, and come in a bewildering array of styles and functionality.

It's a shame these are generally completely inaccurate, as behind them there are fascinating stories of intimacy and technology, computers and psychology. Throw in some science-fiction utopias and dystopias, loneliness and companionship, law and ethics, privacy and community and there is so much to be learned about our future with machines that could care for us and about us. The speaker has spent the past four years learning all about this topic: from 30,000 year old dildos to the world's first commercially-available sex robot (on sale now).

Know what you breath, come build a monitoring device and visualise your results while learning about sensor hardware.&#13;
	&#13;
Attendees&#160;require no prior knowledge or skills, other than enthusiasm and a positive attitude!  &#13;
	&#160;&#13;
We will run 3 workshops during this session (75min each). &#13;
&#13;
The plan of the workshop is as follows:&#13;
1. Introduction: Air quality sensors, programming, building a device&#13;
2. Presentation of the different components of the air quality device &#13;
3. Program it in Python.&#13;
4. Retrieve the data from you and your friends&#8217; devices.&#13;
5. Visualise and compare your data with others at the camp.&#13;
6. Have fun!&#13;
	&#160;&#13;
At the end of the day, we will offer 5 lucky participants the opportunity to take an entire sensor device away with them so they can experiment at home.  &#13;
	&#160;&#13;
We will generate and make public all the workshop plans, notes, code and hardware sources via GitHub (public) so the workshop is repeatable. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-180-air-quality-sensor-devices-build-program-and-test</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1173">University of Southampton - Computational Engineering and Design</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="2ed02539-bc35-5245-be6a-87b7f494b130" id="134"><room>Workshop 1</room><title>Age Appropriate Design Online  &#8212; a new UK Code of Practice is coming</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-08-31T17:30:00+01:00</date><start>17:30</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>What does the future of the Internet look like in the UK?

&#13;
We'll go over how to useLevelKit to build levels and how to mod or create your own Lua scripts to make your own righteous hacks, devices with abhorrent vulnerabilities, or data types that will alter space-time.&#13;
&#13;
The idea being that players, modders and hackers (many of whom caught the hacking bug by messing around with games in the first place) will be able to use the game to tell new and interesting stories about hacking and surveillance, use the platform to build a dialogue around digital activism through play, create new hacking tools in the game, and who knows even drop a 0day or leak a massive political conspiracy or two for real ;P&#13;
&#13;
Come with a laptop and some unique hacking ideas and Rich will help you with the rest. No previous knowledge of Lua or game development required :D&#13;

Including work, family and socal groups.&#13;
&#13;
Using everyday examples the workshop introduces the Drama Triangle (Stephen Karpman https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle) and how it can make our interactions with people go wrong without us knowing why.&#13;
&#13;
In the workshop I'll show how we can spot drama, and what to do about it. I'll use some examples from family, work and social life to recognise 'drama' and provide a way to interact better.&#13;
&#13;
After the workshop, attendees will have the tools to recognise and avoid miscommunication and anti-patterns with affect our daily lives in negative ways.&#13;

An untapped potential of this revolution is the augmentation and possible automation of the invention process. &#13;
&#13;
Everyone has a perception of an inventor as a crazy guy in a shed who is somehow, suddenly inspired. I would like to challenge this view by exploring the process of famous historical inventors to present day inventors and disruptors to give an understanding of how novel ideas come about, before moving onto what invention might look like in the future.&#13;
&#13;
In particular, I would like to share a vision of AI augmented inventors and what this will mean for the democratisation of invention, drawing on my experience as a modern inventor with example patents and progress that has been made so far using new approaches.  &#13;

&#13;
Where aggregation is available to the average user (usually on social media), news feeds are customized on behalf of the user with algorithms they can't understand or control.&#13;
&#13;
To try and solve this problem for myself, I attempted to aggregate web content via RSS feeds, but found most article bodies are just click-through links and no actual content.&#13;
&#13;
That's why I wrote a RSS/Atom reconstitutor, web scraper and search indexer - to be able to get feeds of news, blogs and reports I could read and analyze without the filter bubble.&#13;
&#13;
But this talk is only a *bit* about that - it's the technical backbone around which we will explore surveillance, news as data, the ethics of advertising, and subverting some hilariously paper thin content protections.&#13;
&#13;
In a talk for all levels of technical ability, I'd like to share the things I learned along the way and encourage everyone to question how they can use their own skills to take back control of information on the web and overcome the status quo.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-147-newsveillance</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="562">Matt Carroll</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="561ca7d2-720a-5daa-80cc-21773d68f402" id="94"><room>Stage C</room><title>Why The World Needs A Vagina Museum</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T17:20:00+01:00</date><start>17:20</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>There is a penis museum, but no vagina equivalent.

&#13;
The museum will have four permanent galleries: science, culture, society and history. The science section will cover topics from the anatomy to health, menstruation to menopause, contraception to consent, sexuality to gender identity. The culture collection will showcase the anatomy in the arts and their contribution to the discourse about our genitals, for example The Great Wall of Vagina or The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale. The society gallery will explore genitals&#8217; place in society, e.g. religious rites surrounding menstruation, the practises of FGM, of which over 200 million people are living today suffering from, sexual violence and how these cases are dealt with in court. The history gallery will contain objects relating to the history of gynaecological medicine, contraception, menstrual products and sex work.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-94-why-the-world-needs-a-vagina-museum</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="491">Florence Schechter</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="4814d596-389a-5939-b6b9-7a817ac5437c" id="263"><room>Stage C</room><title>Why and How you should start using Onion Networking</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T18:10:00+01:00</date><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The internet began as a network before firewalls, where any computer could communicate with any other computer without intermediation; but today there are host firewalls, perimeter firewalls, content filters, NATs, DNS limitations, BGP hijacks and all manner of other mechanisms which limit you and your computer's ability to communicate &#8212; and what is a network if not for communication?&#13;

This beautifully animated piece takes Neil Gaiman&#8217;s source material and spins it into a fun and sometimes creepy fairy tale. Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) creates a series of stop-motion set pieces that equally bewilder and delight.

What about encrypted? Can you change that data?&#13;
&#13;
Whether you're reverse engineering an app, want to annoy people (who gave you the permission for this!), or are just curious about data exchanged with your device, this might be useful for you.&#13;
&#13;
After a short introduction to networking, we'll create a basic MITM (man-in-the-middle) setup with your laptop. Your laptop will become a WiFi access point and target devices will connect to it. Network traffic will be inspected (wireshark) and also changed (dnsmasq, mitmproxy). We'll also install a custom CA on the phone to see HTTPS packets.&#13;
&#13;
You will need a laptop with WiFi and Ethernet interfaces, and it needs to run Linux non-virtualised.&#13;
You should be comfortable doing basic admin on your Linux machine.&#13;
Tools we will use: wireshark, mitmproxy, dnsmasq.&#13;
&#13;
After the workshop, try it out yourself at home on a TV, toaster, or other networked device.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-390-who-is-my-phone-talking-to-setting-up-a-man-in-the-middle</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1357">Domen Puncer Kugler</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="aea8079d-e1ec-5c73-a084-15052a5e1b08" id="449"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>Build a Z80 Retro Computer Kit</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-08-31T17:10:00+01:00</date><start>17:10</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>The RC2014 is a Z80 based computer kit that runs Microsoft BASIC, and introduces you to the cutting edge world of computing in the late 1970s!&#13;

It is distinguished from many others in the same field by its use of 2-way communications for authentication and its use of encryption to protect the data transmissions - the majority of RFID technologies at 125KHz feature no authentication or encryption at all. As a result it has been widely used to provide secure building access and has also been used as the technology that implements car immobilisers.&#13;
&#13;
In 2012, academic researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio D. Garcia and Josep Balasch published the seminal paper, &#8216;Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2&#8217; that presented three attacks on the encryption system used in HiTag2. They implemented their attacks on the Proxmark 3 device (an RFID research and hacking tool) and gave several high-profile demonstrations, but didn&#8217;t release any of their code or tools. Since then, the forums supporting Proxmark 3 and RFIDler (another RFID hacking tool) have received many requests for implementations of these attacks, but until recently none had been forthcoming. Garcia et al went on to produce a fast correlation attack in the 2016 paper, &#8216;Lock It and Still Lose It&#8217;.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk I will explain how HiTag2 RFID works in detail, including the PRNG and the authentication and encryption protocols, and will present my own implementations of the attacks, written for RFIDler and supported by desktop computers. The first attack uses a nonce replay to misuse the integrity protection of the comms in order to allow access to the readable RFID tag pages without needing to know the key. The second, third and fourth attacks use time/memory trade-off brute force, cryptanalytic attacks and a fast correlation attack to recover the key, such that the contents of the read-protected pages can also be accessed. The attacks are weaponised and permit cloning of tags, which I will demonstrate.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-73-cracking-hitag2-crypto</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="351">Kev Sheldrake</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="395e35a5-806c-54d8-943c-0a88bdcd060b" id="206"><room>Stage B</room><title>Full communism and free pickles - life lessons from Ursula K Le Guin</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-08-31T18:10:00+01:00</date><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>This year we lost Ursula K Le Guin, a writer whose work began to shape my worldview when I first read her Earthsea books as a child.

Go behind the scenes with an ethicist and co-author of the Association of Computing Machinery's (ACM) new code of ethics that affects hundreds of thousands of computing professionals and get some answers to the following: What is a Code of Ethics? Why bother updating the old code, or having one at all? What's the code asking me to do, and why? How can I practically use the code? How did you decide whether something is good or bad, or whether something should be included in the code? What if my boss thinks codes of ethics are for losers?

First, we will build our very own "glowie" torch (coincell + LED + tape) to keep, explore the brightness of different colours of LEDs and each attendee will get to pick which colour they want to use for the second stage.&#13;
In the second stage of the activity, we will head outside into the dark (or twilight) and take some long exposure light painting photographs. Common things drawn in the past include initials, basic shapes or just simple lines.&#13;

&#13;
I have created a workshop that introduces ideas about what is important in drawing and what are the steps to creating a picture using terminology familiar to people in tech.The workshop consists of some theoretical parts and engaging hands-on exercises, aided by a custom tool. Exercises include drawing cylinders from several angles while being aware of the 3d shape of the object, using a custom grid to copy a sketch and doing several iterations of thumbnails to explore an idea for a drawing. All the while, feedback and suggestions are offered to the participants.&#13;
&#13;
The end outcome is that participants gain more confidence in their drawing abilities, go deeper into drawing even simple forms and understand that the underlying process for drawing is not a magical fuzzy path, but consists of many sequential and &#8216;deterministic&#8217; steps.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-346-drawing-for-techies</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1320">Karolina Alexiou</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="1f0a6aba-2bc2-5b96-9e8d-ac1c9ba5765d" id="208"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>Build a DIY EMF detector</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-01T11:20:00+01:00</date><start>11:20</start><duration>1:30</duration><abstract>Detect the Electro Magnetic Fields at EMF camp!&#13;

There are some really simple and accessible but interesting techniques in the craft that I think maker folks may not have come across, and are really handy for (for example) rapidly prototyping enclosures with nothing but a scalpel, some PVA and cardboard.&#13;
&#13;
Bookbinding involves some beautiful materials as well - it's not so hard to make your Maplin (RIP) plastic enclosures look less beige if you know how to put them together.&#13;
&#13;

From a length of wire into some hand crafted jewellery/belt/strap, chainmaille shouldn't be difficult, or elitist. There are many resources out there, and many things to try. It does take a long time to produce a piece, so it's not a cheap thing to purchase, but it should be cheap and easy to practice.&#13;
&#13;
In a couple of hours, I will teach how to make rings from wire, explain aspect ratios for rings, and some basic sheet weaves (E4 in 1, J12 in 2). We will then move on to some chains using the basics of these weaves (Box chain, Byzantine Chain, Helm Chain).&#13;
&#13;
If there is time and/or interest after this, I'd welcome some time looking at specific projects and helping to start those projects off.

Find out by becoming part of the processor for a few hours! In this workshop, all the participants will be able to be part of a giant micro:bit - teams will race against each other to run different programs, each attendee being a part of the machine. There&#8217;ll be a small workshop at the beginning and the end so that we demystify the way computers work and understand what we're all doing.&#13;
&#13;
This is a good companion to other programming workshops because it turns the concept on its head, with the participants running, not writing, programs.&#13;
&#13;
It isn't just about *being* a CPU though, our aim is to optimise one. After running the first program, your team will be able to make changes to the CPU's arrangement and operation to optimise yourselves. If you've ever asked yourself "what does it mean to be part of a 5-stage pipeline?" or thought "Can I try branch prediction today?" then this is definitely the workshop for you. If you don't know what those things are, then this is the place to learn what it means and have some fun.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-149-be-a-computer-demystifying-assembly-language-and-cpus</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="567">Jonny Austin</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="0fe4e2d4-c646-56d6-a700-55912b700c6d" id="520"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>We Built a Phone Network at EMF - AMA</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-01T21:10:00+01:00</date><start>21:10</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Come and ask the Eventphone &amp; GSM teams anything about the phone network, how they built it, what challenges they had, why X doesn't work or generally ask then stuff about telecoms, GSM SMS and Phone Numbers.&#13;

They can be used as a way of expressing feelings, explore simple emotions and tell points of view.&#13;
&#13;
Bitsy is a tiny tool made especially for creating games which are based on exploration and narrative. Its pixel art minimalistic visual style makes it perfect to just sit down and make a game in a short period of time.&#13;
&#13;
The output is a simple HTML file, so the game is not only playable almost everywhere, it&#8217;s also really easy to distribute and opens chances of hacking and tinkering.&#13;
&#13;
We will learn how to create games with Bitsy, both from a technical point of view and from a narrative point of view. We will explore space layout, dialogues, rhythm.&#13;
&#13;
At the end of the workshop you&#8217;ll be able to create small narrative experience to enjoy with your friends, to deliver powerful messages and to dip your toe in the crazy world of game making. So, come on over with your laptop. It&#8217;s going to be great fun!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-350-tell-stories-in-pixels-and-games</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1322">Federico Fasce</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="86717866-90a3-5c80-a4ee-585531ce75f4" id="429"><room>Workshop 1</room><title>Dorset Buttons</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-01T16:40:00+01:00</date><start>16:40</start><duration>1:00</duration><abstract>Ever wondered how to make a Dorset button?

To build the Spectrometer and process the acquired data, we will use the instructions and the web based software made available by http://publiclab.org/about [1,2].&#13;
We will complement the experience with various scientific details behind the working principles of such device and what could be investigated with it.&#13;
Participants will learn what is light, what is a "color", how a color is associated to the actual light spectrum by the human visual system, details about the color filters embedded in cameras and in particular the physics behind the generation of light from light sources.&#13;
We are part of a group founded in 2013 and we studied different STEM subjects and share a common passion for science, technology and dissemination. We recently founded a nonprofit association named NOVA, offering innovative workshops and learning experiences.&#13;

As a scientist (and failure enthusiast), I am trying to encourage my community to talk more about failure, which is difficult since the path to success is to publish about successes and to hide failures. Let's do more to talk about failure as a Maker community. Let's be honest about the dead-ends and dumb mistakes that got us to that early prototype. Rather than ridiculing 'fails', let's instead celebrate them, since they're what we learn from and allows us to become better than we are.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of teaching people that failure is bad, let's teach them how to be resilient to failure - give them a safe space to fail in, and provide them the encouragement to keep working towards success. &#13;

About the artist:&#13;
Cutlasses is the solo project of musician and DIY electronic instrument maker, Scott Pitkethly.  &#13;
&#13;
He has given a number of of talks on the subject of DIY instrument building, as well as talks on other programming related subjects.  His electronic instruments won the Music Hackspace DIY Instrument award, and have featured on sites such as Hackaday and Create Digital Music. The homemade instruments combine both analogue and digital electronics to manipulate and deconstruct audio.&#13;

&#13;
Using new technologies, you no longer need to be a specialist to design clothes and shoes that fit perfectly. We will bring examples, including 3D printed sandals, a shoe last and insole, laser cut fabric and 3D printed accessories.&#13;
&#13;
We will also highlight textile related developments in makerspaces including the raspberry pi 3D body scanner scanner we helped design at BuildBrighton, and hope to inspire more people to get involved in shaping new DIY technology.&#13;

They are used by well dressed individuals to show their projected quarterly earnings, by primary school teachers introducing exciting new ideas to wide eyed children, and by news organisations trying to explain that it's definitely ok to drink that 5th cup of coffee. But all's not fair in charts and graphs, intentionally or not they are not always faithful to the data. How can you spot a misleading chart, and what happens when what they don't reflect the truth? &#13;
&#13;
In this talk we'll tour the visualization jungles, looking at some of the scariest, most dangerous, and weirdest visualizations out there. You'll learn some of the tricks used to change what a visualization shows and see examples of some previous weird and wonderful visualizations. By the end of our tour you'll know what to watch out for in your future visualization adventures, and how to make you own visualizations a little less intimidating or misleading to fellow adventurers.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-389-a-tour-through-the-visualization-jungle</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="398">Fearn Bishop</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="0d6a6b26-8061-5188-a4a2-dcc02ebc765b" id="200"><room>Stage B</room><title>Numbers vs Resources: The History of Banking</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T17:30:00+01:00</date><start>17:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Tagline: "I almost wish there were a conspiracy, but I'm afraid it's much worse than that."&#13;
&#13;
It is a widely, but vaguely, appreciated fact that banks and banking are powerful and important aspects of modern history, which affect almost all aspects of politics and society. Most thoughtful people, reflecting on the present trajectory of history, get the uncomfortable feeling that we are all being driven toward economic, political and ecological disaster, and that international banking has something to do with it.&#13;
&#13;
This has made banking the focus of numerous conspiracy theories, most of which contain useful and verifiable information, but all of which fail in one key respect: they all subordinate the banking system to the agency of secretive groups of people who supposedly control the whole system across generations.&#13;
&#13;
The conspiracy scenario, bad as it is, holds out the comforting thought that if we could just identify and take out the shadowy figures who are really in control, then everything could be put right. But what if the truth is even more terrible? What if the system has its own internal logic, like a virus or an algorithm, which needs no human hand to guide it?&#13;
&#13;
This talk goes back to the basic principles, and the medieval Italian and English origins, of the banking system to explore its algorithmic properties. I will argue that credit systems are not only a powerful tool in the hands of human and organizations like governments and corporations, but also that they have revolutionary effects on the priorities and and agendas of those organizations. That the tool, in other words - like Elric of Melnibone's 'Stormbringer' or Faust's 'Mephistopheles' - guides the hand that seek to wield it.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-200-numbers-vs-resources-the-history-of-banking</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1191">Patrick O'Connor</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="4dfc7d34-24ea-5fa4-b6ce-75902ab3e7b9" id="302"><room>Stage B</room><title>The Battle of Mosul: what does it mean to live in a post-Geneva Convention world</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T18:10:00+01:00</date><start>18:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The Battle of Mosul in 2017 was a turning point in world history, even though we think of it as just another one of the awful events of today's wars.

&#13;
WaveNet is a machine learning algorithm developed at (Google) DeepMind which was the first to obtain human-like quality of voice directly modeling waveforms. You can read more about it here: &#13;
&#13;
https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/ &#13;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet&#13;
&#13;
Since the original paper was published, there has been several developments to substantially speed up audio generation (several order of magnitude) in order to put it into production, and it is now powering Google's assistant voice in several languages. See also: &#13;

https://deepmind.com/blog/high-fidelity-speech-synthesis-wavenet/ &#13;
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435&#13;
&#13;
Note that the technology is not limited to audio and can pretty much work with any signal, but this is so new that we're just scratching the surface of the potential applications.&#13;
&#13;
In my talk I will be talking about the basic tech, what it took to get it into production and the more recent developments. I would also like to give a few suggestions and hints on how to reproduce these results: the latest version (WaveRNN) is rather simple to implement and yet very powerful.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-406-wavenet-whats-behind-googles-voice</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1386">Norman Casagrande</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="85d31a4c-c031-53d4-8dba-9247f85b3a92" id="413"><room>Stage B</room><title>The Truth, Post-Truth &amp; Nothing Like The Truth</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T19:30:00+01:00</date><start>19:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>How does social media mess with our relationship to reality?&#13;

But what's the point of protecting yourself if the web services you use are vulnerable to big scary hackers?&#13;
&#13;
If you want to catch a glimpse of penetration testing, come along and learn about concepts such as discovering vulnerabilities, running through them, exploiting and patching them.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will be based around a University coursework project, where an older version of web forum software "phpBB" is examined, exploited and patched. The technologies that phpBB was built on were quite simple, so the main focus of the talk will be the process of penetration testing.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the topics covered will include sanitising user input, as well as enforcing file and variable scopes. You will familiarise yourself with concepts such as never trusting user input and get to see exploits such as cross-site scripting and remote code execution.&#13;
&#13;
Lastly, we will wrap up by patching out these vulnerabilities and hopefully learn a thing or two about building more secure software.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-371-attacking-websites-for-educational-purposes-only</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1339">Andrejus Kostarevas</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="3e415f45-662b-54b2-aa73-0de18f03f59c" id="111"><room>Stage A</room><title>Don't Feed Them After Midnight: Reverse-Engineering the Furby Connect</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T10:30:00+01:00</date><start>10:30</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>Furby is a cute little guy, but what exactly is going on beneath that lurid neon fluff?

&#13;
I've spent the last 4 years researching spider silk at the University of Nottingham, learning how spiders have spent the last 386 million years adapting their silk to perform in a massive range of tasks. But now, scientists and industry professionals are looking into how we can adapt spider silk for our own purposes. Want a giant net that can catch falling Jumbos? We're on it. How about a biocompatible silk scaffold to help regrow that broken bone? We're on that too. &#13;
&#13;
This is a 30 minute talk on the subject of spider silk aimed at those with an interest in, but no specialist knowledge of, science. There will be some pictures of spiders at the start but should otherwise be friendly for those who are interested but wary of things with eight legs. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-357-spider-silk-hacking-natures-strongest-fibre</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="181">Michelle Strickland</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="2db1023d-2bc6-5f9b-a3d9-9fa873268e32" id="38"><room>Stage A</room><title>Burnout and Your Meat Computer</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T12:00:00+01:00</date><start>12:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Maybe you've been doing too much for too long.

&#13;
This phrase is often used to try and justify bigotry and prejudice, especially against people who are LGBTQIA+, polyamorous, or women who don't fit traditional gender roles. But is it true? What do we mean by "natural"?&#13;
&#13;
As a bisexual, polyamorous biologist and science presenter, Antonia Forster is keen to set the record straight (no pun intended). What behaviours do we see in nature? What's the difference between gender and sex? Can animals be gay, bi or trans? Are there organisms with more, or fewer, than two sexes? Prepare to see the animal kingdom as you've never seen it before...&#13;
&#13;
This talk has previously been delivered to 2,000 people at TEDxBristol, and watched by over 14,000 online. Antonia has also spoken at Wilderness Festival, Kew Gardens, the Royal Society, Stanford University, Bristol Pride, the OvalHouse Theatre, BCFm Radio, and BBC Radio Bristol. Antonia has been nominated for the John Maddox prize for "promoting scientific understanding in the face of hostility"; and continues to campaign for under-represented groups, especially LGBTQIA+ and women in STEM and science media.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-405-lgbtqia-behaviour-in-animals</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1372">Antonia Forster</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="2c92955a-6c61-5617-9d0f-2220d224aaa1" id="445"><room>Stage A</room><title>Why volunteers are unsung heroes of science </title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T14:00:00+01:00</date><start>14:00</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>A almost entirely factually accurate comedy set about the difficulties of getting people to experiment on when you're studying pain and fear, covering how utterly essential volunteers/willing subjects are to all human science and the perils and pitfalls of studying cognition in small children and babies, (and how they&#8217;re much smarter than we think). </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-445-why-volunteers-are-unsung-heroes-of-science</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1470">Charvy Narain</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="9fa468c9-6458-5c16-8cec-9bfdbd8da905" id="393"><room>Stage A</room><title>Banned from encrypting</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T14:30:00+01:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>We were legally banned from using encryption on our computers, and were required to email the police every time we purchased a new computer, due to a &#8220;Serious Crime Prevention Order&#8221; lasting 5 years, which expired recently.

&#13;
We maintain the specification for Matrix as well as release open source reference implementations of servers, clients, SDKs, bots and bridges to support the wider Matrix ecosystem.  As of Aug 2018 Matrix has around 5.5M reachable users and over 8000 server instances, ranging from individual personal servers through to massive deployments for governments and telcos - and a huge community of open source contributors building alternative clients, bots,  bridges, servers etc.&#13;

Today Matrix is in late beta, but as of the end of 2017 the protocol is feature frozen as we converge on a 1.0 release later in 2018.  In this talk we'll give an overview of the Matrix protocol, the ecosystem, the road to 1.0 and show off all the latest clients and capabilities - including some of the more exciting non-IM usages, such as VR communication!</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-264-power-to-the-people-liberating-online-communication</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1249">Matthew Hodgson</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="576a4696-f8a7-5726-b1a6-3b0f97445622" id="478"><room>Stage A</room><title>5 things we can all learn from Flaming Pianos </title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T16:30:00+01:00</date><start>16:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Along with my friend Sawn, I run a Youtube channel where we build kids' invention ideas.

&#13;
At EMF2016, I talked about numbers stations - mysterious, Cold War shortwave radio stations. After doing that talk, I realised that the thing that I find most interesting about the numbers stations is how they became an urban myth, a living legend of the networked age.&#13;
&#13;
For EMF2018, I'll examine the intersections of technology and folklore. I'll have a look at examples of our old folklore and superstitions following us into the spaces created by new technologies, and I'll also be looking at new folk tales that arise from our technologies, from World War II gremlins to Slenderman and the new cults of AI and Big Data.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-425-things-that-go-bump-on-the-net</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1408">Henry Cooke</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="12b7a1ce-f999-5750-b925-75339577d47e" id="492"><room>Stage A</room><title>Animatronics and robots in the movies with Matt Denton</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T18:30:00+01:00</date><start>18:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The talk will follow Matt&#8217;s progress through his career designing, developing and deploying animatronic control systems from the mid 1990's to present day, with the goal to make animatronic performances more lifelike and simpler for the puppeteer.&#13;

With algorithms making important decisions in healthcare, transport, finance, security, even what we watch, how much should we rely on them? What kind of future do we want?&#13;
&#13;
You are accused of a crime. Who would you rather determine your fate &#8211; a human or an algorithm? An algorithm is more consistent and less prone to error of judgement. Yet a human can look you in the eye before passing sentence.&#13;
&#13;
You need a liver transplant to save your life. Who would you want in charge of organ allocation? An algorithm can match organ donors with patients, potentially saving many more lives. But it may send you to the back of the queue.&#13;
&#13;
You&#8217;re buying a (driverless) car. One vehicle is programmed to save as many lives as possible in a collision. Another promises to prioritize the lives of its passengers.

&#13;
With the rise of blockchain cardgames, paper cryptocurrency and washing machines being bricked by ransomware, never has there been a better time for people to take the stage and attempt to convince everyone that they too understand the nonsense on the projector.&#13;

Ultimately pushing them to better secure their services and thus protecting your privacy.&#13;
&#13;
After a short introduction you'll be surfing the web, finding names, addresses and urls of the UK government and adding them to the map. They will automatically be scanned for basic security. If all is well, they are shown green, otherwise orange or red. Expect a lot of red.&#13;
&#13;
The results of our work will be sent to various press agencies in the UK. We hope they start asking questions about the sad state of security. This causes responsible organizations to wake up and adopt better practices, securing your data and privacy. We've seen this work in the Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
You can expect: It's a lot of fun to see the amount of data grow, and more terribleness appear. Club Mate will be provided. The hunt is on!&#13;
&#13;
Requirements: This workshop is suitable for anyone with basic computer knowledge. Bring your own laptop / tablet / smartphone.&#13;
&#13;
All data gathered is published publicly in easy to consume formats. The software running this is fully open source and available on gitlab.

However, it is almost certainly true that most people have never had the life-changing experience of tasting a truly authentic Mexican taco. Furthermore, I would imagine that most people would never think of attempting to make one at home, despite the fact that it is such a simple dish.&#13;
&#13;
As a keen home-cook, who has lived in Mexico for the past 10 years, I am hoping to share this experience with people with a passion for trying new things.&#13;
&#13;
I will explain a little behind the theory of what makes a good taco, as well as introduce people to the core elements and constituents.&#13;
&#13;
This will primarily be a sensory experience where people will be able to compare "good" vs. "bad" ingredients, and learn the basics of putting together a simple but delicious taco.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-137-the-art-of-the-taco</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="555">Simon Bedford</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="99536bc5-5aee-599c-98e5-1ae77c00d7ee" id="246"><room>Workshop 2</room><title>How long will it take the beat The Tomb of Horrors?</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-01T20:20:00+01:00</date><start>20:20</start><duration>3:00</duration><abstract>The Tomb of Horrors is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure designed to be almost impossible and a distinct challenge for D&amp;D players. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors I am going to run a developing session for 5 players at a time. It will continue until all the characters die. Then we'll start again with the next group! It&#8217;s likely that the first few groups won&#8217;t take too long, and if they stick around to watch further groups they&#8217;ll learn more ways of getting to the end. &#13;
&#13;
It will be fun for novice and veteran D&amp;D players, but likely not beginners.&#13;
&#13;
It is thoroughly recommended that you bring some good time spirits, as crowd participation will be encouraged. Booing, Cheering and Drinking are all advised.&#13;

&#13;
A drinking horn is a great natural and individual drinking vessel, but can be made even more personal with a hand carved symbol or decoration to make it truly unique.&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop, you will be selecting the design you will put on your horn, transfer it onto the horn, use a traditional Viking Dremel to carve the design, then polish and paint it to finish off the horn.&#13;
&#13;
After this workshop, you'll have your horn to enjoy your beer and mead with for the rest of the festival. So try not to make any holes in it!&#13;
&#13;
If you really want to go full Viking, then more Viking stuff will be available from SkullVikings at the Cyber Viking village.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-368-carve-your-own-viking-drinking-horn</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1340">Steve Samuels</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="a9b8823f-1d0a-567f-8fda-2ebdfa121544" id="275"><room>Workshop 4</room><title>NFC Nail Art</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-01T13:20:00+01:00</date><start>13:20</start><duration>1:30</duration><abstract>This workshop puts the pretty and the geeky together by combining UV gel nail art with NFC technology. NFC (Near Field Communication) is a peer-to-peer radio communication method which allows devices up to 4cm away from each other to communicate (more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication). Its uses vary from contactless payments to smart cards, access fobs and file sharing, making it a vital communication tool.&#13;
The workshop will include:&#13;
- introduction to gel manicure&#13;
- brief introduction to the NFC technology&#13;
- programming NFC data tags&#13;
- placing NFC LEDs and data tags on nails and incorporating them into a nail art composition&#13;
The end result is a happy participant with a creative gel manicure involving NFC activated LEDs and a custom programmed nail which can perform various things: unlock a phone, open a browser and navigate to a link, open a specific application, link to a business card, etc.&#13;
&#13;
This workshop would be open to all ages and genders, with an option to paint a fake plastic nails instead of own nails if that&#8217;s preferred; each data tag and diode stickers are around 8mm wide so that can be useful if someone has smaller nails.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-275-nfc-nail-art</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1260">Kinga Kieczkowska</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="da814856-b3a8-5e61-b676-476753b1afeb" id="502"><room>Workshop 4</room><title>Build a rocket</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-01T15:10:00+01:00</date><start>15:10</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>Build a simple solid-fuelled model rocket from scratch!&#13;

We'll provide some stickers, felt tips, glitter, etc, but feel free to bring your own too! You can also customise the build to your heart's content and we'll be on hand to advise.&#13;
&#13;
Also suitable for young children with some supervision. The build involves mostly scissors and tape, one step involves hot glue which requires adult supervision.

From wartime rallying songs to football terraces to "If you're happy and you know it", we sing to encourage the troops; to celebrate epic victories; to cheer on our favourite team.&#13;
&#13;
Whose battles are more epic, whose victories more heroically won than global corporations with enough spare marketing budget to commission their own soundtrack? &#13;
&#13;
In this talk I will take my audience through the history of the corporate song, from IBM's rousing classic 1937 songbook "Songs Of The IBM" to modern masterpieces such as "We Built This Starbucks (On Heart And Soul)" (it's exactly what it sounds like from the title) and "Symantec Revolution", hailed by the Observer as "The worst song in the history of music (with added sinister corporate overtones)".&#13;
&#13;
I'll explore a number of different musical styles (or at least, attempts at those styles) and try my best to answer the question, "Why? Just...why?"</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-457-the-art-and-science-of-the-motivational-corporate-anthem</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1476">Kate Tolley</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="32de6472-fc39-5c43-bdfe-964db83e79a0" id="446"><room>Stage C</room><title>Never Mind the Molluscs: (Mis)Adventures in "Aggro-Rhythmic Composition"</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T10:30:00+01:00</date><start>10:30</start><duration>0:40</duration><abstract>Hear vicious venomous molluscs and baroque bifurcation diagrams!&#13;

You could already buy knitted scarves of elementary cellular automata and simulated sea shells, now you can listen to what passes for tunes!&#13;
&#13;
Fabienne Serriere's generative knitting patterns drew attention to Hans Meinhardt's book "The Algorithmic Beauty of Sea Shells", the code that came with it is being slowly resurrected. Abuse of inverse short-time Fourier transforms in Python turns shell patterns into sounds.&#13;
&#13;
We'll also stop worrying and learn to love the digital by exploring reasonably analogue chaotic attractor sounds with a Raspberry Pi and some cheap digital to analogue converters. Somewhere between a talk and a performance, this follows on from appearances at EMF 2016 and SHA 2017 where noises were caused to happen on stage and some people clapped afterwards.

Most people didn't get it at first and some are still surprised it's not going away. But podcasting has not only survived three global hype cycles it's also one of the most resilient and unique media forms on the Internet. So far, Podcasting has successfully resisted being sucked up by a single YouTube-style platform that looks helpful in the beginning but would set the rules of its community in the future.&#13;
&#13;
Instead Podcasting is very much alive and has proven to be able to create new and serve to existing communities, communicate effectively to its audience and establish a following other media types haven't seen yet. Podcasts are sexy and you really want to know why.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will explain in detail why podcasts matter, what makes podcasts magical when combined with community, why almost everybody should consider starting a podcast, which infrastructure on the net is actually useful, what kind of hardware is actually needed and what open source and free-ish tools exist to publish high quality audio content on the web today.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-477-the-secret-powers-of-podcasting</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="350">Tim Pritlove</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="0dd79d26-8190-5873-afff-128be49dc052" id="433"><room>Stage C</room><title>Open Bionics: Turning children with limb differences into bionic superheroes </title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T12:20:00+01:00</date><start>12:20</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Open Bionics is a robotics startup developing assistive devices that enhance the human body.

You learn that this magic box can be programmed to do all sorts of amazing things, but are never really given the details as to how it does it. I wanted to know more, and after some research I started making logic gates with the one bit of electronics I knew how to use: Electric relays. I scrounged parts from cars, microwaves, scrap change machines, etc and put them together into increasingly complex contraptions. Two years later, I had TIM 8: a fully programmable 8 bit relay computer. This is the story of how TIM 8 came about, what I learnt along the way, and how relay computers are a fantastic way to demonstrate how a computer really works.&#13;
&#13;
For the talk I would bring a presentation and TIM 8 (the size of a small suitcase).</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-35-the-tim-project-building-a-relay-computer-from-scrap</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="302">Rory Mangles</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="9bc64cce-86d9-5a68-9413-7591ab247f92" id="412"><room>Stage C</room><title>Hacking using SAT and SMT solvers</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-01T13:40:00+01:00</date><start>13:40</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>For both SW and HW hacking, SAT and SMT solvers and their associated toolchains could be used to automate a lot of boring tasks for you, getting you to the next stage of that exploit chain you have been working on, or just helping you make sure there are no exploitable bugs in your soft- or hardware. In this talk I will go into what SAT and SMT solvers are, what kind of solvers are out there and give some practical examples in using them both to find, e.g. crack codes or bugs in systems. In particular, I will showcase some interesting use-cases of SAT solvers for cryptography, SMT solvers for puzzle-solving, and concolic execution (using SMT solvers) for automated bug-finding.&#13;

But is that the answer for our 'golden' years? How do we plan and prepare for what's ahead?

&#13;
The main aim of this challenge was to build a machine learning-driven tool that can automatically identify news and other written articles about &#8216;Internally Displaced Persons&#8217; (people who have been forced from their homes by conflict or disaster). The platform also had to be able to extract key facts about the underlying events mentioned in the articles.&#13;
&#13;
I would like share the story of how our team, that had never met in person, put together a platform using almost 100% open source tools, and ultimately won the competition. We were subsequently invited to Geneva to help implement our platform, and we presented it to the broader non-profit community at an event at the International Red Cross museum.&#13;
&#13;
During my talk the areas I would like to address are:&#13;
1. My experience of learning &amp; getting involved in data science/programming/machine learning as a non-professional programmer&#13;
2. What it was like to work on something constructive with a team from around the world that had never met each other&#13;
3.

But what if a CA makes issuance mistakes?  What if a CA is hacked?  What if a CA is run by the baddies themselves?!  Who watches the watchers?&#13;

Certificate Transparency is the latest internet security superhero.  Power: detecting certificate misissuance and certificate authority misbehaviour (oooh yeah).&#13;

&#13;
It is still very much a work in progress, but in this talk we will explain and demonstrate some of the technical challenges we have faced so far in bringing the project, including its bewildering array of ancient and modern control systems, to life. &#13;
We hope to share our experiences of some of the challenges from our journey so far and hopefully encourage other hobbyists who are considering taking on larger than average projects to just get out there and do it!&#13;

It's often used to solve problems such as spam email detection, natural language translation, to find images matching certain search criteria, or to make music recommendations. This talk will turn the problem around and examine the extent to which neural networks can emulate human creativity. We'll start by thinking about what it means for an algorithmic system to be creative. Then through examples we'll look at how techniques in machine learning can be used to compose original music and generate art. During the talk, we'll see how changing the algorithms and modifying the inputs to the neural networks affect the music and art created. We'll conclude by discussing future directions in the field of computational creativity, and thinking about whether computers will ever be able to match human levels of performance in this area.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-396-computational-creativity</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="429">Matthew Ireland</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="5ddf927f-ce93-5699-9201-a15b946cbcce" id="533"><room>Stage C</room><title>Special Presentation: Hackers (12)</title><type>performance</type><date>2018-09-01T20:20:00+01:00</date><start>20:20</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>Celebrating the first UK release of Hackers in blu-ray format, we are proud to present this classic on the big screen in full HD.&#13;

The youngest children could then decorate their wand with natural resources, (or I could provide some coloured string, ribbon, feathers etc).  The older children could use basic woodcrafting tools such as potato peelers to strip the wands and whiltting knives to add carving notches for decoration, in addition.   I would imagine the younger children finishing earlier, but for older children this taking about an hour.  I would prefer all children to be accompanied by an adult, especially if they are hoping to use the tools.

But unfortunately it's not always easy for people to access them. Women, BME (Black and minority ethnic) people, people with disabilities, older people, and people on low incomes are often under-represented in makerspaces. In the first part of this workshop I&#8217;ll share some of the ways that makerspaces are managing to include people from these groups. Then I'd love to hear your stories about any successes and challenges you've experienced with building inclusive and diverse makerspace communities. Even if you don't have any success stories, if your makerspace hasn't been able to spend much time on engagement, or if you're not even involved in makerspaces but are curious about technology engagement issues, you're welcome to come along!&#13;

We will be exploring how Science Fiction can teach us a few things about the creation of new technologies. We will be focusing on the future of 3D Printing, but the process I will guide you through can be applied to anything and everything. This will provide a great opportunity to flex your creative muscles and question how we want to use technology in the future. We will be using a combination of sketching, drawing, sketch modelling, illustrating, doodling&#8230;pretty much anything you want to create your 3D Printers of the future.  &#13;

&#13;
A drinking horn is a great natural and individual drinking vessel, but can be made even more personal with a hand carved symbol or decoration to make it truly unique.&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop, you will be selecting the design you will put on your horn, transfer it onto the horn, use a traditional Viking Dremel to carve the design, then polish and paint it to finish off the horn.&#13;
&#13;
After this workshop, you'll have your horn to enjoy your beer and mead with for the rest of the festival. So try not to make any holes in it!&#13;

&#13;
You'll learn the basics of how to turn soft, non-scratchy, merino wool fibre into a useable yarn. How to tweak your spinning to make yarns suitable for different purpose, and how to finish your yarns ready for use. We'll also cover the different kinds of plant and animal fibres, and their properties in spinning. There will be an oppourtunity to see a variety of different fibres, but wool will be the only fibre availiable to work with, as it is by far the simplest for beginners.&#13;

Attendees will be able to follow fully featured step-by-step instructions, including hi-res build photos accessible through the internet on any browser. Care has been taken to make the PCBs easy to assemble.&#13;
During the workshop I would like to point out:&#13;
-	What is a PCB anyway?&#13;
-	Solder, why are there so many different types? What should I use?&#13;
-	Soldering best practices and handy tips i.e. how to apply heat and solder to a joint.&#13;
-	Variations in components and the distinctions between polarised and unpolarised parts.&#13;
&#13;
During the workshop I would like to have attendees assemble one easy kit and one intermediate kit. The easy kit is a classic noisemaker/synth circuit, the mini APC (Atari Punk Console) including a small speaker. &#13;
The intermediate kit, which most beginners can handle after soldering the mini APC is a simple 8 step sequencer. The sequencer is able to sequence the mini APC by way of control voltages and gate signals, if all goes well the tent would be filled with people making 8 step musical loops.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-194-soldering-beginner-to-intermediate-synth-kit-workshop</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1183">Darren Blaxcell - rakits.co.uk</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="b1fc40c3-3cf0-53c7-8e94-750df1dea592" id="319"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>Introduction to web accessibility</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-02T13:20:00+01:00</date><start>13:20</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>How do people with disabilities use the internet? Accessibility and inclusive design have gained popularity recently, but a lot of web developers are still unaware of what they can do to make their sites and apps work for everyone. Even with a lot of goodwill, practical knowledge is needed: it can be overwhelming to try to use a screen reader, use the internet without a mouse, get notifications with no audio or empathise with reading and cognitive impairments. Things like ARIA and tab order logic can also be intimidating and may lead developers to make experiences worse when they think they are improving it.&#13;
 &#13;
This workshop will be part-talk, part-practical, to demystify accessibility: why it matters, what are the things to consider, how to test and find issues, and most importantly what you can do to fix them. Participants will have hands-on exercises of using a screen reader on their own devices, navigating using just a keyboard, and identify what's a good and a terrible experience. We will work on hands-on exercises with HTML and JavaScript to fix custom components, understand the logic, and for more experienced developers we will cover ARIA components and building accessible custom elements like accordions and tab panels.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-319-introduction-to-web-accessibility</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="92">Victor Loux</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event><event guid="5a559b2a-293c-5ab0-89e2-82c57c19d59a" id="296"><room>Workshop 3</room><title>Introduction to Japanese Bookbinding</title><type>workshop</type><date>2018-09-02T15:40:00+01:00</date><start>15:40</start><duration>2:00</duration><abstract>Because who doesn't love stationery and making things.

&#13;
I will provide a selection of battery powered noisy toys for participants to experiment with, but they're also welcome to bring their own too. We'll begin with a short introduction, which will also cover a safety briefing (always avoid capacitors) and some top tips e.g Do not bend anything that you are dearly attached to, or is difficult to replace. Usually circuit bending does not harm your targets, but sometimes things go wrong and you might accidentally fry the piece you are working on.&#13;
&#13;
After everybody has the chance to find the noises within the toy we'll all connect up to the PA system and get everybody jamming together - collaborating through music and digital creativity.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-240-circuit-bending</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1223">Frazer Merrick</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>true</optout></recording></event></room><room name="Stage B"><event guid="ba740df3-581a-5d43-a5dd-9239138874fe" id="340"><room>Stage B</room><title>Shaping sound</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T10:00:00+01:00</date><start>10:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Light is managed using lenses, objectives, telescopes.

&#13;
In this talk, I will introduce another way: using 3D-printed materials, specially-engineered to manipulate sound. Using tractor beams, levitation pods (for polystyrene beads) and other demos, I will guide the audience towards a (not-so-far) future where what we see in science fiction movies like Iron Man or Minority Report is real. A world where two people will be able to listen at two different programs from the same radio or to receive personalised sound messages without headphones. A world where music at outdoor festivals and in beer gardens will be managed while preserving airflow.

Well now it&#8217;s the turn of smart materials.&#13;
&#13;
This is a show about the future of stuff. Within our lifetimes, solid objects will react, sense, change and move according to their surroundings. This won&#8217;t be a result of fancy robotics or cunning electronics, but rather the fundamental properties of the materials themselves. Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s flying machine, drawn over 500 year ago, smart materials will make our aeroplanes of the future adapting, sensing and morphing, so that they fly like birds or bats. In years to come, we will be living in self-regulating houses, riding self-fixing bicycles, and driving on self-illuminating roads, all thanks to smart materials. These are metals, plastics, fabrics and fluids that react to the outside world without any human involvement, and they promise to change the way we live our lives forever.&#13;
&#13;
In this one hour show, an award-winning materials scientist and engineer will be your guide on the smart material safari. There will be demonstrations of the smart materials that exist today, and exploration on how they will make the material world around us smarter tomorrow.

Are you a musician who wants to get into multitrack recording? Are you an electronic artist looking to build a digital studio? Or just curious about the tools people use to make music?&#13;
&#13;
The free and open-source world contains a rich selection of music software, from synths to sequencers, drum machines to DJ decks, MIDI to mastering. Take a tour of this colourful world as we touch on a number of important musical tools and see and hear how they fit together into your toolbox. Whether you're interested in making a recording studio, creating your own digital sounds, performing live or just understanding a bit more about the creative process, there's something here for you.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-450-making-music-in-the-free-and-open-source-world</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="86">Gavan Fantom</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="26cd66f4-fc02-59eb-b007-c60403e6bd7a" id="76"><room>Stage B</room><title>From Idiot to Imposter: how to get started in a new field</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T15:30:00+01:00</date><start>15:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>At EMF it's easy to see lots of cool things and think you "that's awesome, but I couldn't possibly do that!": this talk is about how to overcome that feeling and get started in a new domain.&#13;
&#13;
Two years ago, despite having not done any woodwork since high school, I decided to turn my hand at building electric guitars; with success enough that people are now commissioning me to make them for them. But to keep such an ambitious project manageable I had to create structure and tools around how I approached getting started and continuing to develop, and find ways to keep myself motivated in the days when it all goes wrong. This talk will review those methods so that you can try and apply them when you go to head off in a new direction yourself.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-76-from-idiot-to-imposter-how-to-get-started-in-a-new-field</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="438">Michael Dales</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="7493184f-be1b-5d75-9fbe-ea28eedab0b8" id="176"><room>Stage B</room><title>How to Climb a Mountain.</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T16:10:00+01:00</date><start>16:10</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Its difficult to say how many mountains in the world have never been climbed - probably thousands. Breaking new ground is always exciting, whether in mountaineering or mathematics. We'll talk about our experiences making several first ascents of unclimbed peaks in the Indian Himalaya and the Kyrgyz Tien Shan, and some of the surprising similarities to our other lives in research and development. We'll cover some of the specifics of pulling off a climbing trip further afield than the Alps, and also talk generally about big projects in unknown territory.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-176-how-to-climb-a-mountain</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="1616">Andy Vine</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="c610923d-f293-5ddc-964c-8837c110cee7" id="14"><room>Stage B</room><title>SHA2017 - Behind the scenes of a hacker conference</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T16:50:00+01:00</date><start>16:50</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Everyone has visited a hacker conference, but not many have seen it through the eyes of an organizer.

This inspired me to build my own in 2008 and along the way I discovered how to program in C, Arduino's, IMU fusion algorithms, not realising this would be as hard as it turned out to be. A gyro was &#163;160 back then, a 3 axis IMU is now about &#163;5, how things have changed.&#13;
&#13;
Since then I have built one and two wheeled boards, 2 wheeled wheelchair prototype and many others, documented on YT and Instructables, long before such gadgets came out from China, culminating in a 3000W hubmotor 1 wheeled motorcycle which I plan to bring to the camp and demonstrate. I test these on Pembrey and the famous Pendine Sands beaches in Wales, with video clips I can present.&#13;

In this talk I&#8217;ll walk you through the infrastructure and services that we chose to set up at our lab, as well as the rationale behind the choice. We&#8217;ll explore how can people communicate better with the right tools, and what is needed to maximize collaboration potential.&#13;
&#13;
The talk starts with what is in our experience needed to communicate effectively in a medium sized group (50-100 people), and then illustrates the tools and open source software that can be used to achieve that. There will be details on how to set up Discourse, Gitlab, Dokuwiki with central authentication via SAML and how FreeIPA can be used to manage hackerspace members&#8217; access to both external (public) services and internal (wifi and computer login).</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-92-bootstrapping-a-hackerspace</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="489">g5pw</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="6e1b13af-1c2e-592d-9541-b1df4cf83475" id="97"><room>Stage B</room><title>Out daemons, out!

This semi-improvised ambient performance, composed especially for EMF Camp, will last around 20 minutes, and will be made using only instruments and effects I have built myself. &#13;
&#13;
The piece will employ mechanical, contact mic based, noise makers, DIY digital effects running algorithms designed by myself and analogue sound sources and combine them into a mini DIY orchestra, which will serve to demonstrate the nature of my DIY instruments, as well as being an artistic piece in it&#8217;s own right.&#13;

This talk first gives an overview the technology used, why you would use it, and giving some examples of where it is being used today. It then follows the challenges of rolling out a regional LoRaWAN network.&#13;
&#13;
This is an accessible technical talk. It contains technical information of interest to those wanting to work with this technology, but it should be understandable by those who are less technical.&#13;

&#13;
Over the last 10 years or so I've been developing different types of CT scanner and finding uses for them that are not just the usual day-to-day teeth &amp; bone scanning that is expected of them.&#13;
&#13;
From watching teeth dissolve in real time in fizzy drinks, determining if there is a maggot in my lunchtime apple, and discovering inaccessible text in a 14th century parchment roll, to recovering a lost episode of Morecambe and Wise and X-Raying my lunch. These are just some of the uses and, arguably abuses, of the equipment I get to play with.</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-65-the-use-and-abuse-of-ct-scanners</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="255">David Mills</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="9bac0999-cb07-521b-9881-12e69677a049" id="284"><room>Stage A</room><title>Why automated number plate recognition systems suck</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T14:00:00+01:00</date><start>14:00</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>Earlier in the year i was confronted with an ANPR system at the garage at my house so i started playing with it. &#13;

&#13;
The topic does cover areas of speed control and other forms of law enforcement. I have not attacked those but assume that the attack would also work there.

The peach emoji, for example, has been found through research conducted by emojipedia to refer most often not to the fruit, but to buttocks. Other fruit and vegetables emoji have suffered a similar fate.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk I will explore the ways that emoji are frequently misunderstood or misused - referring to some of the leading research conducted by academics in the area. I will conclude with peer reviewed research that I have conducted looking at the ways we assign new meaning to emoji when communicating with a single other person. Why do we do this and how do we choose the emoji we use. Why is it that despite there being a heart emoji available, some of us choose to use &#127829; to say "I love you"?&#13;
&#13;

From alkaline hydrolysis to freeze-drying, there are many (legal) ways to dispose of a body. Whether you want to nourish fungi, roses, a coral reef or the minds of trainee doctors, your remains could make the world a better place. Why be scattered, when you can leave behind something way more interesting?&#13;
&#13;
This session will look at what actually happens in a crematorium and a burial (both traditional and green) as well as some of the more unusual alternatives that are now available to dispose of a body and the controversies that surround them.&#13;
&#13;
Please note: if you just can&#8217;t live with your spouse any more, or you have a life-long vendetta against someone, this session won&#8217;t help you get that sorted out. Seek counselling. Buy a pet. Get out more. But don&#8217;t kill them.&#13;

But the most amazing things about modern microprocessors is that they work so incredibly reliably despite all their incredible complexity.&#13;
&#13;
This talk is about the battle between complexity and correctness and about how new formal verification tools can be used to help you design higher performance processors that actually work.

This talk is a breakdown of how it all works, the orbs themselves and the game architecture. The hardware inside the orbs, why those parts were selected, and how they interact with each other.  The software design and game architecture, and how all of that flows together.

What will the future hold for the human body and communication when we boldly go into space? What ethical consideration must we take to ensure that it is the many who control their personal data?&#13;
&#13;
We&#8217;ve been making educational, technologically exciting ballets and performance workshops for five years now. As artists we want to do collaborative learning with our audiences, to help them express their own ideas within a collaborative artistic technological framework. It is not just a performance to sit down and watch. Art and performance can break down the traditional barriers to audiences that consider themselves non-technical. We like to release as much of our performance and learning materials as possible as open source.&#13;
&#13;
Our project is long-running, and has tackled subjects from chronic pain to sorting algorithms. Now we are looking to space, brain hacking, and unashamed futurism. How can we begin to live in the future while increasing accessibility and inclusivity? What are the ethical concerns surrounding things that might seem abstract at first glance - like brainwave data?&#13;
&#13;
Classical ballet might sound like a strange way to learn about technology, ethics and medicine, but we hope to change the way you think about education/learning. Combining the algorithmic nature of classical ballet with futuristic thinking, breaking down artificial cultural barriers and fostering personal creative ownership for all. &#13;

My talk will go over the tech I used (suitable for absolute beginners), the mistakes that I made and the lessons I learnt along the way. From learning to use the twitter API, writing my own API, coding for an arduino and wiring the whole thing up to the worst bit, THE SEWING. I aim to spread the message that it is ok to f**k up, that everyone does it and that if you keep trying and keep asking for help, you can make silly things too. </abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-155-tweet-my-wedding-dress</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="573">jo franchetti</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="fa8fc974-943c-526d-be98-d60fb51f2bbc" id="469"><room>Stage C</room><title>Hunting for (un)known particles</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T15:30:00+01:00</date><start>15:30</start><duration>0:30</duration><abstract>The Large Hadron Collider is the latest step in the continuing endeavour of particle physicists to understand our universe.

It is an open hardware, Arduino-compatible musical instrument with a touch keyboard, amp, and speaker.  It is easy to build -- designed for total beginners to learn to solder together.  It provides a very low cost, yet powerful, method for making music/sound/noise, and a fun way to learn Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for generating music/sound/noise. This talk will show beginners how the ArduTouch music synthesizer kit makes use of DSP to create its large diversity of music/sound/noise. Mitch will also explain how the touch keyboard works, as well as the cheap amplifier/speaker built into the board. The ArduTouch Arduino library works on any Arduino board and Mitch will demonstrate how to make use of this library to create your own unique synthesizers -- both by hacking some of the many examples it comes with, and by making use of its high-level functions. This talk will also include a demo of some of the music the ArduTouch can make, as well as some wonderful nasty noise!&#13;
&#13;
A workshop for soldering together ArduTouch music synthesizer kits will be held before the talk on Sunday at 1pm at the Hardware Hacking Area (Camp: G).</abstract><description></description><slug>emf2020-24-ardutouch-music-synthesizer-music-generation-for-newbies</slug><subtitle></subtitle><track></track><persons><person id="162">Mitch Altman</person></persons><recording><license>CC BY-SA 3.0</license><optout>false</optout></recording></event><event guid="e8d31ec2-50a9-5ef3-896d-8586c90dd348" id="524"><room>Stage C</room><title>Building a robot with MATLAB and Simulink</title><type>talk</type><date>2018-09-02T17:20:00+01:00</date><start>17:20</start><duration>0:20</duration><abstract>The talk gives an overview and describes the built-in support for prototyping, testing, and running Simulink models on Raspberry Pi&#174;.

Everything we make - software, hardware, communities - needs to be looked after, if it is useful. Sadly, maintaining, repairing and sustaining can be challenging in a fast-moving era, where this work can be seen as boring and low value, compared to the excitement around inventing or making new things. It is easy to forget that apps, data and connected systems need maintenance too, if they are to realise their potential and be useful or fun for more than a brief moment. &#13;
&#13;
And it&#8217;s not always easy. It can be hard to find good resourcing models for long-lasting products, or for looking after new forms of shared infrastructure (such as open source software libraries). Strong commons models, where groups share and steward resources (whether the knowledge in Wikipedia or open hardware designs) are scarce or difficult to replicate. &#13;
&#13;
We&#8217;ll talk about maintenance, good and bad examples of it, and what we are doing to recognise the work done in repair, custodianship, stewardship, tending and caring for things that matter.  &#13;

They moved a waxwork dummy, accidentally broke off its arm, and discovered that rather than being made of wax, it was made of a real dead guy.&#13;
&#13;
With a bit of investigation, the coroner discovered it was Elmer McCurdy, a failed bank robber who died in 1911.  Between his death and his discovery, he visited sideshows, hung out at Niagra Falls, rode on rollerskates, became a drug addict, and inspired the look of Skeletor from the He-Man cartoons and toys.&#13;

Three women challenged the status quo, demanding recognition, authority and respect. Katherine Johnson rose through the ranks to become one of NASA&#8217;s most respected mathematicians, Mary Jackson became the first qualified African-American female engineer in the USA and Dorothy Vaughan saw the coming of machine-based computers, becoming one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on programming.&#13;
