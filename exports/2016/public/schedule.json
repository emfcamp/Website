The app is intended to be an open and extendible platform for organising sheet music (the notation for classical music given to players in an orchestra or similar), a problem which hasn't really been solved by other software even though there's plenty of software which can help you compose new music. \r\nTalk will cover reasons I think the problem hasn't been addressed, problems working with music formats, some thoughts on how we perceive sheet music and Optical Music Recognition, particular issues technically with Python and forcing a single codebase to work on Windows, OSX and GNU/Linux, and how the app turned out in the end.

Details of how MRI images are created using the primary \"electromagnetic field\", the variable gradient field coils, radio pulses sent and received, and processing via Fourier transforms to generate actual 2D/3D data images.\r\n\r\n2.  The common standard (DICOM) used by all vendors to attach patient information etc. to the images and to send them to the \"Picture Archiving Communication System\" (PACS)\r\n\r\n3. The process of storing and indexing the images in the PACS, including the challenges of the large volumes of data used.\r\n\r\n4. The subsequent options for viewing the images, including simple 2D manipulations and 3D rendering.\r\n\r\nOther types of imaging (Simple X-rays, CT, Ultrasound etc.) will also be covered.\r\n",

I'll discuss a few awesome feats achieved by natural materials, such as plants that launch their seeds ballistically, snapping venus flytraps, sea cucumbers which go solid when you pick them up, and bivalve muscles that just don't quit. Some underlying concepts from how these work will be drawn out and explained, and I'll highlight attempts to use these concepts synthetically, along with the tech behind them - a substantial amount of which uses 3D printing or related technology which is accessible at a hobbyist level. Finally, we'll wrap up with applications, challenges, and directions that I reckon attendees could definitely contribute to. Onward, to a shape-changing future!",

A-Frame is a beginner-friendly but capable entity-component framework by Mozilla folks to create VR experiences from markup and code. \r\n\r\nEveryone who can slide a smartphone into a cardboard is welcome for this workshop. I will teach the basics and cover some advanced concepts like coding interactions and components with JavaScript. But mostly you will explore and experiment. \r\n\r\nAfter the workshop everyone should have a good understanding to create their own VR worlds in a few lines of markup/code. Imperfect VR: We are not aiming for a perfect reality but will have fun in the virtual. Cheap 3D assets. Blocky textures. Weird sounds. We want to stumble around the EMF campground with smartphones in our faces. Forget VR mainstream. Motion sickness will not be avoided but guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe files for the workshop are here: https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr\r\n\r\nImperfect VR is inspired by \"Imperfect Cinema\" by Allister Gall / Dan Paolantonio (http://www.imperfectcinema.com/) which is inspired by \"For an imperfect cinema\" by Julio Garc\u00eda Espinosa (http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC20folder/ImperfectCinema.html).\r\n\r\nYou might also watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuG8ElyirC0.",

With reference to developing for the web, I describe specific, manageable sources of information overload for us as developers and show how development in general is a continuous learning process.\r\n\r\nIn order to hack our how we learn, it\u2019s important to understand a little about how learning happens. To that end, I outline the points of attack by relating the current understanding from the field of cognitive psychology on how our thinking and learning processes work.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll use simple examples throughout to show how we can manage our projects more effectively, write clearer, more maintainable code, and actively manage our own learning journeys, as well as assisting the journeys of those we work alongside. With this knowledge we should be able to make our development process more efficient and reduce the risk of information overload both for ourselves and others.",

    "description": "Within the UK, school computing has changed beyond recognition in the last 10 years. 2012 saw the Royal Society publish the hugely influential \u201cShut down or restart?\u201d report, which has been followed by a complete curriculum turnaround\u2026 in England. What\u2019s followed has been invigorating and challenging, but it\u2019s not been easy. In England, skills gaps are a problem. In other parts of the UK there seems to be more of a \u201csit back and wait to see how those English people get on\u201d attitude. For the enthusiastic outreach nerd, this is an interesting time: working in after school clubs, one-day sessions, robot open days, summer camps, and tech activity development can be hugely fun and massively rewarding. It can also be utterly frustrating, demoralising, and can sap the life force from your very soul (if you had one to start with). \r\n\r\nThis talk will describe what works, what doesn\u2019t work, what you (yes you) can do, and why we should take this seriously. What should you do if you\u2019re trying to run a workshop for 40 kids with varying levels of experience? How can you help a group of homeschooling parents teach programming? How can you write something that\u2019s used more than once? \r\n\r\nThe currently anonymous proposer has a decade+ of experience as a tech person trying to encourage the world that tech is actually fun. This will be a frank talk about real workshops and real kids, with practical advice and a barely concealed undertone of ranty feminism. \r\n",

    "description": "CANUTE, an open source multi-line refreshable Braille display. The project has been developed using Bristol Hackspace as a base and workshop facility. We are a Not For Profit venture and are working on open sourcing the project because having an open source design and data protocol will open up the avenues to information and equipment it can link into and information it can display. Available displays are at best two lines, Canute will be 8 or 16 lines and affordable.\r\n\r\nThe blind community are currently poorly supported with literature as very little is transferred to bulky Braille paper format and this has an impact on literacy and employment and access to modern communication. So much information is displayed 'on the screen' and Text-To-Speech is not always convenient (and is often inconvenient) and is a very different experience to reading. We aim to reverse this with CANUTE which will be the world's first electronic multi-line refreshable Braille display. It will be an entirely new class of affordable device to bring Braille to people who would otherwise be unable to afford anything other than massive, bulky hard copy Braille from a very limited source.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 years of development on gifted and sponsored budgets in the corner of a Hackspace using Chinese motors and gears from ebay, lasercut parts and 3D printed widgets crammed into a fat laptop sized box, with an Arduino brain and Raspberry Pi book library we have made a working prototype that can display an entire page of Braille.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no machine available to demonstrate. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bristolbraille.co.uk/",

Hackers are a vital part of this evolutionary process, exploring the so called \u201cadjacent possible\u201d by constantly interconnecting, short-cutting and sometimes downright breaking the barriers between social and technical systems.  This talk will bring insights from current  academic research on  Complex Adaptive Systems and Universal Darwinism, explore their relevance for the hacker community and attempt to make them actionable  as a set of guidelines for hacking this co-evolutionary process.\r\n\r\nThe proposed format is an interactive lecture of 45 minutes to an hour,  with maybe  a game or two thrown in for a good measure.

    "description": "We've all seen lockpicking explained on several security venues. You might even have tried it yourself. But what if you need to open a lock a number of times? Wouldn't it be great to have an opening technique that would supply you with a working key in the process? \r\nA method to do this has existed for quite some time, but until recently it has remained quite unknown. Some time ago impressioning locks got \"re-invented\" by the lockpick community and the skill evolved to the level now shown at several international championships. \r\n\r\nUnlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will. With practice, this technique can consistently open a lock in 10-15 minutes (and potentially faster)!\r\n\r\nWhat is it? How does it work? What skill is involved? Why is it the most interesting way to open a lock? These questions, and more will be answered in this talk.\r\n\r\nJos Weyers (@josweyers) is a world-record holder in the field of lock impressioning and a mainstay at LockSport events around the world. A long-time member of TOOOL in the Netherlands and a key figure at the Hack42 hackerspace in Arnhem, Jos is the Vice-President of TOOOL.nl and helps to oversee that organization and the LockCon conference.

If you contribute code, how can you be sure you're not just giving your time to help someone else get rich?\r\nLegally, on the whole open source is great at the licensing end but very shaky at the ownership end. It's too easy for owners to exploit the contributions of others and very hard to find a way for developers of open source to earn a day's pay for a days work. Is it a straight choice between software as a restricted, expensive product or software development as voluntary work? \r\nI am a corporate lawyer and I believe there is a third way.

    "description": "Claude Elwood Shannon was a pioneering mathematician and engineer, of paramount importance in our digital revolution. 2016 sees the centenary of his birth. Whilst he is most widely known as the \"father of information theory\", the extent of his influence across computer science, physics and engineering is incredible. This talk aims to mark his centenary with an exploration of the man, his work and his legacy. In the spirit of his practical, \"hands-on\" nature, our discussion will be filled with examples, experiments and demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe talk will start by explaining his unifying theory of the transmission of information, which provides the basis for all modern communication: without his work we would have no Internet, no mobile telephones, and no theoretical understanding of the limits of data compression. We'll move on to briefly examine his formulation of digital logic circuits in Boolean algebra and present his design of a 4-bit adder circuit in relay logic. Finally, we'll conclude by exploring some of his lesser-known inventions: the first computerised learning device, the first chess-playing computer program, the first wearable computer, a juggling robot, and the \"ultimate machine\".",

    "description": "There's been some big changes in the UK maker community over the past couple of years: the number of makerspaces and hackspaces around the country has mushroomed, private makerspaces have popped up in companies and universities, and \"maker\" has become a buzzword for corporate PR departments. Mainstream journalists and bloggers have started writing about us, giving people outside the maker community an impression of who we are and what we do without them ever setting foot in a hackspace or maker faire.\r\nSo are we still a DIY grassroots knowledge-sharing community? Are our hackspaces as open and inclusive as we think (or thought) they are? Do we still have the same values that we did when the first UK hackspaces opened seven years ago? And are most makers still white middle-class dudes?\r\nIn this talk I present the results-in-progress of my Masters research into the state of the UK maker community in 2016. It will be the result of conversations with makers from all areas of the community (hackspace members, FabLab staff, creative freelancers, university students, maker faire exhibitors), plus non-makers, to find out how we see ourselves and how other people see us. It's the first step in a larger research project to find out how we can make our community more inclusive and how we can reach under-represented audiences.",

I would accompany the talk with a series of photographs showing the hacks the selves and other related moments in the space.",

I'll talk about some 3D prints I designed to help try to visualise four-dimensional objects. Just as a shadow of a three-dimensional object squishes it into the two-dimensional plane, we can squish a four-dimensional shape into three-dimensional space, where we can then make a sculpture of it. If the four-dimensional object isn't too complicated and we choose a good way to squish it, then we can get a very good sense of what it is like. I'll talk about the sphere in four-dimensional space, the four-dimensional polytopes (which are the four-dimensional versions of the three-dimensional polyhedra), and various sculptures, puzzles, and virtual reality experiences that have come from thinking about these things.",

    "description": "Every modern computer processes digital data on successive ticks of a synchronising \"clock\". We are all familiar with using the speed of this clock to reason about the performance of our devices: in 2000, a desktop might have run at 500MHz; now, it would not be unheard of to see a 5GHz clock. The existence of this clock makes processor design very convenient, and in the early days clocked designs generally proved faster and used fewer components than their unclocked counterparts.\r\n\r\nHowever, in recent years we have seen a plateau in increasing clock speeds: computers are no longer getting \"faster\", per se. We have uncovered many disadvantages of using clocked circuits: the clock is power-hungry, it is difficult to distribute across a modern chip, all circuits are constrained to operate at the speed of the slowest, and clocks may cause electromagnetic interference to other nearby devices.\r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the human brain, this talk will examine two fundamentally different methods of computation that are either asynchronous or analogue in nature. They do not rely on a clock to advance the state. We shall simulate and explore these methods through interactive, graphical means. Asynchronous circuits have the potential to be faster than clocked designs and require far less power. Electronic analogue computers have the further advantage that they do not suffer from numerical errors that arise from approximating real numbers using a finite number of bits. Might one of these techniques shape the future of our technological society?",

    "description": "How fast is it possible to complete a game like Super Mario World, if you could control every frame of input to ensure a perfect run?  Tool-assisted speedruns are recorded frame-by-frame using emulators which allow slow-motion gameplay, going back and undoing mistakes, and even using bots to search through many possible combinations of inputs. By removing human limitations, these speedruns get closer and closer to the theoretically perfect play.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents highlights from the last 15 years: frame-perfect movements, exploiting bugs and oversights, and manipulating randomness to get miraculously good fortune. There will be videos of speed runs, including both popular and obscure games, and even a game completed in less than 0.3 seconds of gameplay time.\r\n\r\nThere are many techniques which are used in making a speedrun. Sometimes people will disassemble the game's code to understand how it works, in order to find new ways of beating it. Sometimes people will find and exploit bugs, allowing them to move through walls, go faster than normally possible, or skip whole sections of the game. In extreme cases, bugs allow players to execute arbitrary code, allowing them to take complete control of the console.\r\n\r\nIn short, this talk is about taking games to their very limits.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "How might you re-order wagons in trains without lifting them off the tracks or prevent trains from colliding when you cannot see where they are? What does a train travelling through a station indicate about simultaneous events and how do railway junctions lead to problems in ethics? This talk combines several interesting problems in railway operation, within the context of real railway operations, showing surprising applications in computing they inspired.\r\n\r\nShunting yards present logistical problems arising from the marshalling of wagons. The UK's former largest yard near Sheffield was so complex it required a paper tape era computer to operate. However, in computing we find their structure used in diagrams for programming language grammars and a type of parsing algorithm known as the shunting yard algorithm which we'll see in operation.\r\n\r\nThe computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra devised many railway-themed computing ideas. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest route between stations, a method independently discovered by early rail planners in the UK. Thanks to railway signalling, Dijkstra introduced semaphores into concurrent programming. We'll show how the concept works both for railways and concurrent systems and outline the historical context of rail accidents.\r\n\r\nRailways introduced universal time. Einstein's celebrated thought experiment involving a moving train changed how we understood simultaneous events. Distributed systems rely on proper ordering of events. We'll explore these problems plus solutions.\r\n\r\nThe talk includes the Trolley Problem that first arose in philosophy but is now the subject of its own vibrant meme.",

Just when do you give in and call the army to come and take it away?\r\n\r\nGet tips from a design engineer, and follow one hacker's journey through the world of dangerous and difficult tech, tearing down devices such as Flight Data Recorders, Geiger Counters, Emergency Positioning Beacons and Anti Submarine Warfare hardware.\r\n\r\nLife threatening injuries not included.\r\n",

    "description": "A lot of noise, extensive discussions and many articles have been written lately due to the recent, so claimed, airplane hacks. It is indeed very difficult, up to impossible, to find information about the actual security of an airplane's systems if you are not actually the person responsible for designing and building such systems. Of course, it is understandable that these details regarding these systems will never become available to the general public for security reasons.\r\nDue to my background in security, I always looked at the airplanes from a different perspective and after reading so many articles online I decided to share with you what I have come across after all these years. Personally, I am an airplane enthusiast and I have been studying and learning about airplanes all my life, mostly as a hobby. I started with the best flight simulators I could get my hands on, sat down with many real pilots to learn all the technical details and I have a few flight hours in a real simulator of a Boeing 737-800. \r\nThe purpose of the talk is to present you with small truths and facts about airplanes I managed to gather over the years. The facts I am going to present you with will help you better understand if what you reading about airplanes' security is actually true or a misleading story based on fictional facts and assumptions. \r\nThe presentation will allow you to draw your own conclusions about the security of airplanes' avionics and in-flight systems while looking a bit closer to the so called in-flight entertainment systems. \r\nFasten your seat belts and join me to an interesting presentation that will take you away to a fantastic trip.",

    "description": "Inside the MIT Media Lab, the story behind the photo: In 2013 a small group of student from the Lab were asked to help with the design of a front cover of the FT magazine, the idea was to represent all the facets of the Lab through physical objects. We decided to try our best to represent the all community and during two weeks we explored the Lab meeting new people, discovering their projects and scavenging for physical artifacts. We ended up spelling the title of the article out of physical objects including a DIY air liquifier, the internal mechanism of a robotic underwater anemone, LEGO blocks, a robotic prosthesis, a hyperviolin, a gyroscopically stabilized electric unicycle or a Mobile Social Dextrous robot. Through this story I want to present the Media Lab from my own experience of working there but also explore the notion of the cohesion of such a place behind the happy chaos of a pluridisciplinar and pluricultural  community.\r\n",

    "description": "Cyber insecurity often feels like a horror story, and the idea of cyber security an out-of-reach myth. The last couple of years have seen breaches that are bigger, and of a higher profile, than ever before. When we trace these breaches back to their cause, we often find that attackers took advantage of human behaviour, via social engineering, poor password management, gaps in physical security or malicious insiders. Organisations are increasingly focused on raising cyber security awareness, and the UK government has spent millions of pounds on the Cyber Streetwise campaign, and yet we seem to be making little (if any) progress when it comes to changing behaviours. \r\n\r\nThis talk argues that, in lots of ways, we are making fundamental mistakes when it comes to our attempts to raise awareness. Combining sociological and psychological research with mythology and classic horror fiction, this talk highlights lessons we can learn in our approach to raising cyber security awareness. Emphasising ways we can positively engage with people to change behaviours for the better, this talk aims to provoke ideas and discussions that will lead to awareness-raising programmes that are focused on what the 'user' needs to know, and how we should be telling them, to achieve the most impact and make cyber security less of a monster.",

    "description": "At Delft University of Technology we are developing a six legged robot inspired by a beetle. Instead of building complex and expensive robots, we  build simple and cheap robots. This allows us to construct a lot of robots and use them as a swarm. Just like computer engineers found out that some problems (e.g. travelling sales man) can be solved by copying behaviour seen in nature, the same thing applies to hardware. For example, we see that animals have multiple layers of intelligence: reflexes needed to stay alive are generated by the spine, and the brain adds a layer of more complex, but less stable intelligence. This can be copied to robots by implementing the spine in a microcontroller, and implementing the brain on a processor running linux. These robots are build in all sizes. Ranging from a model you can hold in your hand, up to a model that is over half a meter in length.",

There are hundreds of rubbish USB devices around with unsupported software and locked down pc requirements. Luckily, these devices are often actually very easy to reverse engineer. I'll briefly outline how USB works, and then describe how I reverse engineered several USB devices - including a USB desktop visualiser (avermedia CP-155) and a laser cutter (HPC 3020) using just virtual machines and wireshark, and found that many undocumented USB devices are surprisingly simple.

This is v0.1: we finished soldering the boards on Thursday; we don't know how well they work; the code (currently only for Android) continues to be developed as of Friday.  The workshop's goal is to open the project to a larger community, spurring further development.  At worst, you'll get to walk around wearing tin foil, a bathing cap and electrodes; at best, you'll be able to identify various EEG signals on your phone.

    "description": "About four years ago I built a diesel motorbike, the most successful of three I have made. I would like to share the experience of how, using minimal tooling and tight finances, I successfully adapted a road registered motorcycle to be powered by a diesel engine and the problems I encountered to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe drive to do such an unusual thing was partly the engineering challenge but mostly the amazing fuel economy and I now  get about 140mpg from it. The spark that started this bike was from an engine given to me at my 40th birthday camping weekend. You'd think it was a thoughtful and expensive gift but my friends actually found it on top of a rubbish dump attached to an abandoned refrigeration unit. However it was of good stock and worth mending and eventually made its way into a bike that covered over 40000 miles before needing attention. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting fact is that I built it in about a week due to a personal crisis. It was built mostly in the spare room of my house using parts I had I the attic left over from other projects and support from a generous friend with a big lathe. \r\n\r\nI have attend the annual diesel bike meeting regularly since it started eleven years ago as well as occasionally visiting the one in Germany so can chat about the broader community of diesel bike builders.",

It's both possible and easy to assemble those by hand. You can do it, and I'll teach you how. Think you don't have the tools? Think you can't manually place 0402s? Everything is possible with patience and practice. The equipment is minimal and you probably already have it. We're going to build two switch-mode power supplies (one step-up, one step-down) using tiny SMD parts. They're going to work. We'll learn the answer to THERE'S A SHORT ON A TINY PART OMG WHAT NOW? After this, you'll no longer need to be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before the workshop, because shaky hands are a disadvantage.",

Cyborgs hack their pacemakers, program their bionic limbs, and gain extra senses. My implanted NFC transponder allows me to unlock my phone with a wave of my hand, but uniquely identifies me to any nearby antenna.\r\nIn this talk I present my preliminary research into the idea of an API for the human body. What does it mean for a human to become assimilated into the Internet of Things? Why would I want to expose part of my body in a globally addressable space?\r\nThrough the partiality of web standards, the irony of illegal prime numbers, the intimacy of teledildonics, and the perversity of JavaScript, this short talk will inspire you to become a cyborg, or teach you how to hack one.",

From Swartz's help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz's groundbreaking work in social justice and political organising combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties. Source: IMDB\n",

    "description": "A dazzling, surprising and sometimes hilarious animation in three different styles that interprets a ancient Indian story. Roger Ebert declared \u201cI was enchanted. I was swept away\u201d.\n\nSita is a Hindu goddess, the leading lady of India\u2019s epic the Ramayana and a dutiful wife who follows her husband Rama on a 14 year exile to a forest, only to be kidnapped by an evil king from Sri Lanka.  Despite remaining faithful to her husband, Sita is put through many tests. Nina (the filmmaker Nina Paley herself) is an artist who finds parallels in Sita\u2019s life when her husband \u2013 in India on a work project - decides to break up their marriage and dump her via email. Three hilarious Indonesian shadow puppets with Indian accents \u2013 linking the popularity of the Ramayana from India all the way to the Far East - narrate both the ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this beautifully animated interpretation of the epic.\n\nIn her first feature length film, Paley juxtaposes multiple narrative and visual styles to create a highly entertaining yet moving vision of the Ramayana. Musical numbers choreographed to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw feature a cast of hundreds: flying monkeys, evil monsters, gods, goddesses, warriors, sages, and winged eyeballs. A tale of truth, justice and a woman\u2019s cry for equal treatment. Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline as \\\"The Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told.\u201d From: www.sitasingstheblues.com",

You are then able to plug in your headphones and hear these sounds that are normally outside of our hearing range, from the sound of ants footsteps to those of a spider, any insect.\n\nIf it's too loud to hear the insect on camp, there are recordings of the sounds of ants to hear and you can still test the mike out in its shoe box. It can detect lost of other everyday sounds that we wouldn't normally hear.\n\nBring an insect if you find one and lets try!\n\nhttp://minusonic.designbywatson.com/\n",
