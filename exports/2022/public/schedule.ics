 witter with various comedy bots from Clickbait Robot\, and Yoko Ono Bot to
  the horrible monster hit Fesshole (currently 350\,000 followers when Rob 
 typed this.)\n\nIn this talk Rob will tell some anecdotes from a behind th
 e scenes.\n\nBe prepared to be moderately amused\, this won't be the most 
 serious of talks. \n\n(And please put me on at a time when people are in a
  silly mood rather than 11am and everyone is horribly sober.)\n\nLink: htt

DESCRIPTION:We take a scenic tour through the origins of the UK train tick
 et\, from the original BR specification in the 1980s through to modern rep
 lacements like mTickets\, eTickets and ITSO. \n\nThis is just a detour tho
 ugh\, and we'll focus on the 'orange ticket' (RSP 9399/9599) - which conti
 nues to be a stalwart of the UK rail network. Surely they can't be that se
 cure? After all\, anyone can encode a magstripe - right? \n\nWe'll take a 
 look through the data encoded on these tickets\, what interesting things y
 ou can do with them and maybe (assuming I've got it working by then) we'll
  be able to read and write our own! \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/sche

DESCRIPTION:Back in 2018 I got involved in an arts project called Pick Me 
 Up and Hold Me Tight\, by ZU-UK.\nThe goal was to raise awareness of male 
 suicide by making all 34\,000 UK pay phones ring at 11am on New Years Day.
 \n\nInitially I backed their crowd funder as it seemed like a good cause a
 nd also I was curious how they were going to make that many phone calls te
 chnically. This is the story of how I ended up as the technical lead on th
 e project and what we did to make a lot of phone calls in a very short spa

DESCRIPTION:Using end of life or 'scrap' EV & Hybrid parts and opensource 
 firmware I'm making an electric motorbike\, having got tired of making dir
 ty diesel ones! \n\nThe scrapyards are now filled with slightly broken EVs
  and Hybrid cars\, and almost no one knows what to do with them. As a resu
 lt the parts they are made from are very affordable and available for repu
 rposing and hacking into your own projects.\n\nThe project is far from com
 plete so there is nothing to bring to the show as I was hoping but there i
 s lots to talk about and discuss regarding the state of play of hacking sc
 rapped and discarded power inverters. \n  \nThe motorbike project uses a b
 attery from a BMW i3 electric car\, the motor is from a Mitsubishi Outland
 er PHEV & the main power inverter for driving the motor is from a hacked P
 rius running open source firmware with the motorcycle running gear from us
 ed motorbikes and a whole host of other bits connected together in ways ne
 ver intended.\n\nThe project is only possible using the work done by the E
 V car hacking community Openinverter.org and their community forum which h
 ave reverse engineered the EV power controllers allowing you to run open s
 ource firmware on them with some minor alterations. \n\nLink: https://www.

DESCRIPTION:"The Enigma Machine was an electro-mechanical device used in t
 he mid-20th century to encrypt communications. An ingeniously simple and e
 legant combination of cogs\, wires and lamps\, all fitting into a portable
  case\, it provided some of the strongest encryption possible at the time.
  During various Covid-19 lockdowns\, I decided to re-enact this important 
 development in the history of computing\, through a project to build an En
 igma machine at home\, using modern components and digital design techniqu
 es. The completed project is made out of cheap hobby electronics parts and
  laser-cut wood\, and can be assembled entirely by hand\, with no gluing\,
  screwing or soldering. I will reflect on what this process taught me abou
 t the challenges of electromechanical computing\, security and usability\,
  the changes in modern manufacturing and supply chains\, and their impact 
 on computing. This will be followed by a Q&A and a demonstration where you
  can see the home-made Enigma machine in action and have a go at encryptin
 g and decrypting a message."\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/202

DESCRIPTION:What\, exactly\, does a gender transition involve?\n\nOver tim

 e degree to which people can now pick and choose what they want in terms o
 f (de)masculinizing and (de)feminizing effects/procedures is astonishing -
  even to many transgender people and medical professionals providing them 
 care. Much of this customization is especially attractive to non-binary (n
 either strictly male nor female) individuals.\n\nFrom simply unbundling th

 surgeries and outright biohacking... come learn about the gender transitio
 n "secret menu"\, compared and contrasted with the traditional options.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Ionizing radiation\, resulting from nuclear reactions or radio
 active decay\, is invisible to the human eye yet it is all around us. Whet
 her it's coming from space\, from radioactive elements in the Earth\, or f
 rom human activity\, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere w
 e go\, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha\, beta\, 
 or gamma radiation is happening all the time\, and curiously\, some object
 s in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods\
 , camping gas mantles\, smoke detectors\, granite table tops and even bana
 nas\, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies
 .\n\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-Müller tube\
 , a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation\, the in
 ert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These 
 charges can be detected using an electronic circuit\, and visualised or se
 nt to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with
  radioactivity in popular culture.\n\nIn this workshop\, attendees learn a
 bout the different types of ionizing radiation\, and proceed to build thei
 r own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-Müller tub
 e. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This
  requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built\, attendees c
 alibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. At
 tendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.\n
 \nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable age range: 10+\nAttendees 
 should bring: Bring a solder iron if you can\, a laptop or tablet is also 
 helpful. Workshop is free\, but donations are appreciated.\n\nLink: https:

DESCRIPTION:Starting with a brief introduction to the concept of Sustainab
 ility and the Sustainability Triangle (Environmental\, Economic\, & Social
  Aspects)\, and introducing my background (exploring the contradictions be
 tween being an environmental activist and a chemical engineer\, working in
  oil and gas\, and moving to waste management). \n\nWe will then move on t
 o a number of short "parables" each exploring an interesting anecdote from
  my career\, and using them to show the inherent conflicts between differe
 nt sustainability domains. \n\n- Environmental: Bird Poo\, trying to convi
 nce a customer than sending skips of rubble for incineration "to avoid lan
 dfiil" was not in fact environmentally friendly\, despite their best effor
 ts to justify this based on the fact it contained some pigeon droppings. \
 n- Economic: Vibrators\, exploring the underlying reasons why my first day
  working in waste management\, comprised having to find a home of 80 oil d
 rums which had been inexplicably filled with sex toys. \n- Social: Chemica
 l Weapons\, how running a project to dispose of "orphaned" gas cylinders o
 f Chemical Weapons and Rocket Propellants discovered lurking in a shipping
  container\, gave me a fresh perspective on our duties to each other as hu

DESCRIPTION:UFO's\, (recently re-branded UAP - Unidentified Aerial Phenome
 na)\, are an extremely strange subject\, but not for the reasons you may e
 xpect.\n\nThe strange thing is that any reasonable person that takes the t
 ime to investigate their long\, if rarefied\, history concludes that they 
 exist. I don't mean they exist in the obvious sense that a weird-looking s
 hiny party balloon at a distance is an unified flying object that exists. 
 No - for well over 70 years\, hundreds of thousands of individuals have wi
 tnessed clearly visible flying craft - disk-shaped\, cigar-shaped\, triang
 les\, "Tic-Tac's" - performing seemingly impossible aerodynamic feats in o
 ur atmosphere. That's just the start of it.\n\nUntil recent years\, gettin
 g an overview of this inscrutable subject has been an unreasonable amount 
 of effort for the average person. "The Phenomena" by James Fox\, released 
 in 2020\, is a feature-length documentary film which gives a compelling\, 
 but sober\, history of the subject. It has great production values\, is ve
 ry well sourced\, and features interviews with extremely high-ranking indi
 viduals in intelligence\, defence\, aviation and governance as well as ord
 inary people with extraordinary evidence. Put simply\, this film will leav
 e you convinced that we are being visited by aliens.\n\nHang out afterward

  (I'm the one with hat\, glasses\, and two white canes).\n\nWe'll discuss

 w †\n• "inner sanctum" hypnotic induction ‡\n• movement\n• groun

  find "emptying your mind" difficult (e.g. due to ADHD)\n‡ very simple\,
  with script 100% disclosed beforehand — no silly stage tricks\n\n\nWe'l
 l discuss several variants of the basic mechanisms\, how to customise to y
 our own preferences\, and personal experiences (iff you choose to share) 
 — but no religion\, metaphysics\, doctrine\, or the like.\n\nPlease:\n
 • wear or bring something comfortable for sitting on grass/dirt\n• bri
 ng a drink & snack\n• pee and stretch beforehand\n• silence all electr
 onics while at the workshop\n• do (only) what works for you\n\nI use scr
 ipts (with included variation suggestions) that work for most people\, but
  not everyone. Please diverge from my instructions if something else feels
  right. That's common\, and kinda the point — particularly for the hypno
 tic induction\, which needs to be tailored to your own experience).\n\nLik
 ewise\, if something feels uncomfortable or triggering\, please switch to 
 a different meditation exercise instead (e.g. the basic breath meditation 
 we start with).\n\nWhat you share is entirely up to you. I won't call on y

DESCRIPTION:The hurdy-gurdy is an ancient musical instrument (10th century
 ) with drones and melody strings bowed by a rotating wheel\, played by pre
 ssing keys which contact them at different points. It featured in TV serie
 s such as “Black Sails” and “Walking Dead” as well computer games.
  A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds ea
 ch and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes
 \, they are loud. For pipers\, practice e-chanters are available while not
 hing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as
  a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation\
 , with some internal electronics\, for my own personal use to learn a few 
 tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse\, a website for sharing 3D printed 
 ideas\, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This 
 open-source project has developed through many variations which I would br
 ing to the talk\, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gur
 dy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable k
 eybox for travelling. It is an electronic device\, with correctly placed k
 eys\, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications syst
 em for electronic musical instruments\, via a USB cable to an attached or 
 wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software. It 
 is a low-cost way to enter the Hurdy Gurdy world and allows practice anywh
 ere using headphones\, thus preventing eviction or divorce!\n\nLink: https

DESCRIPTION:In 1939 World War 2 started and the British Council—Britain'
 s shiny new organisation for overseas cultural relations and propaganda—
 inherited the suddenly-closed tourist board's film-making department. Tour
 ism films are no use in a war\, so the Council turned their topics towards
  more cultural content as a softer kind of propaganda. Thus began a decade
  of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almo
 st totally forgotten in Britain. \n\nBetween 1940–1950\, the British Cou
 ncil produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain
  covering sports\, manufacturing\, landscapes\, art\, architecture\, publi
 c healthcare\, the justice system\, democratic process\, public institutio
 ns like the National Trust and the BBC\, and more besides. \nA far cry fro
 m the Ministry of Information's rigid style\, this collection features som
 e of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (200
 1: A Space Odyssey\, Cabaret\, Superman)\, and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of L
 ife and Death\, Black Narcissus\, The Red Shoes). \n\nDistributed to over 
 100 countries worldwide\, the films are stunning\, dated\, funny\, and biz
 arre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides\, optimistic cities\, str
 ong industry\, forward-thinking social structures\, and hardworking\, happ
 y people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that pers
 ists to this day... \nThat may not be a coincidence. \n\nIn this talk I'll
  cover the history and development of this film collection\, how it was sh
 aped\, who saw the films\, their staggering success\, and their untold glo
 bal legacy.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/281-this-is-bri

DESCRIPTION:Should we really be trying to make our tech indistinguishable 
 from magic? Is there dark magic in tech? And what does that have to do wit
 h a teleporting duck in a classroom?!\n\nWe often hold creating 'a magical
  experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun\, engaging\, sometimes ev
 en playful\, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological ma
 gic has a dark side too\, especially when trying to help people learn and 
 feel confident about technology.\n\nBy its nature\, magic you experience i
 s not under your control: it's a trick\, and you're not supposed to be abl
 e to understand it\; magic is inscrutable\, and for many\, that's disempow
 ering.\n\nIn designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools\, we've tho
 ught a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides o
 f creating of a magical experience.\n\nThis talk will reflect on our strug
 gle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide
  a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.\n\nIt will 
 explain how we attempt to present simple\, understandable analogs of more 
 complicated\, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense co
 nfidence with the tech around them.  However\, it will also look at how we
 've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make thi
 s all work nicely in a classroom.\n\nThrough this discussion we'll look in
  detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO\, the way the micro:bit'
 s USB interface works\, the microphone privacy LED\, the web-based compile
 r and the simple radio communication.\n\nFinally\, I will look beyond micr
 o:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can he
 lp us build better\, more trustworthy tech.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.o

DESCRIPTION:The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a critical element in t
 he success of the Apollo Moon landing programme\, and was one of the first
  digital computers to use the then new technology of integrated circuits.\
 n\nBy modern standards\, its design has many unusual aspects\, such as:\n\
 n- The logic circuits were made entirely from 3 input NOR gates.\n- Design
  was split into 24 logic modules\, but due to limits on gate/chip count pe
 r module\, individual gates were sometimes 'borrowed' from unrelated modul
 es.\n- Shift and rotate operations existed\, but were not available during
  interrupts.\n- Numerical overflows disabled interrupts.\n- There was no s
 tack.\n- Limited memory addressing range\, combined with a need for ever m
 ore memory lead to a complex memory banking system.\n- Word length was 15 
 bits\, ones-complement (mostly).\n- No floating point - everything done in
  integer\n- programmer responsible for avoiding overflows.\n- Single bit '
 Up/Down' Analog to Digital conversion (kind of) throughout\, with the curi
 ous side-effect that the faster the spacecraft was rotating\, the slower t
 he computer would run...\n\nOn top of the limited hardware was built an im
 pressive realtime system supporting cooperative multitasking\, a virtual m
 achine running interpreted commands\, a powerful fault detection and resta
 rt system\, and an innovative VERB NOUN user interface.\n\nThis talk aims 
 to describe the architecture\, with particular focus on aspects which are 
 unusual by modern standards.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2

DESCRIPTION:A few years ago at a virtual conference I related my story of 
 blowing up a BBC Micro B's power supply and alluded to the idea that it wa
 s (for totally anecdotal reasons) due to dark\, occult forces.\n\nThe subs
 equent year I realised that the best defense against accidental occult com
 puting was to do it on purpose so I embarked on a cyber-occult experience 
 to blur the lines between magic and technology\, beginning with writing a 
 Tarot card filesystem (TarotFS) on Plan 9 from Bell Labs\, the awkward cou
 sin of Research Unix.\n\nIn doing so\, I discovered a lot about the value 
 of participatory magical practice even when you don't believe in the super
 natural (and how we all do it whether we realise it or not)\, the surprisi
 ngly short history of the separation between magic and science\, and all t
 he weird junk you can do with Plan 9 under the guise of "occult research" 
 and how it's uniquely suited to the task.\n\nAlong the way I've gathered a
  collection of grimoires (spell books) and other occult texts that instruc
 t the reader on a plethora of "esoteric sciences" ranging from how to stop
  a magnet from working (you put a diamond next to it)\, how to appease all
  the gnomes that the earth is "full to the brim" of whilst you're searchin

DESCRIPTION:In this presentation\, two criminologists and one sociologist 
 reflect on why criminology and sociology often get ‘hacking’ very wron
 g - and on the challenges we faced trying to get it (a bit more) right. \n
 \nWe draw on ongoing research into how involvement in hacking practices ch
 anges over people’s lives\, understanding moves between legal and illega
 l practices\, often occupying all the grey areas in between. This talk is 
 part take-down of previous criminological research into hacking\, part nav
 el-gaze into the difficulties of defining ‘hacking’\, part critique of
  computer misuse legislation and policing practices like PREVENT\, and par
 t moan about institutional barriers to doing hacking research well.\n\n\nL

DESCRIPTION:Travelling by rail in most of the world is one of the safest f
 orms of transport you can take\, and in the UK even minor collisions make 
 the news. But it wasn't always quite that way...\n\nThis talk will be a po
 tted history of the safety of the railways in the UK and Ireland\, startin
 g from the early days when signalling was thought of as an inconvenience\,
  and anything with wheels on it which sort-of went round went on the track
 . Eventually\, the railway companies learned the benefits of adopting safe
 r methods of working (sometimes requiring some encouragement from the law)
 \, leading to the introduction of some Victorian methods we still use toda
 y. Finally\, we look at the more modern era with the railway losing its wa
 y with privatisation\, and onto the current time\, where computers and pap
 erwork solve everything. Perhaps.\n\nFeaturing: Swiss Cheese\, Charles Bab
 bage vs. Brunel\, working too hard\, forgetting where you put your trains\
 , losing your religion\, a dark and stormy night\, drunken driving\, a loo
 se screw\, shifting foundations\, and more.\n\nNo previous knowledge of th
 e rail industry is required. The talk will cover some recent fatal acciden
 ts at a high level.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/104-a-c

DESCRIPTION:Over the past year or so\, I've become way too interested in t
 racking London Underground trains with greater precision than anyone else 
 so far. Transport for London provides an API ("TrackerNet") to get departu
 re boards for all the stations -- but (ab)using that information to track 
 the journeys of each individual train has proven much harder than expected
 .\n\nI'll explain how I built a system to squeeze useful insights out of a
 n API not really designed to provide them -- including a fair few workarou
 nds for TfL's capricious signalling systems\, way more graph theory than I
  have any right doing\, and why I now really hate the District Line. You'l
 l be able to see how applying a carefully tuned pile of random maths lets 
 me go from a chaotic jumble of data to a near-perfect model of the Tube ma
 p!\n\nI'll also cover the practicalities of running this system\, explaini
 ng how I packaged it all up into a website people can actually use without
  getting banned by TfL for using their API too much or overloading the ser
 ver I run it on.\n\nDon't let the mention of graph theory scare you off\; 
 this talk should be appropriate for all audiences\, and should appeal to a
 nyone with a casual interest in railways\, open data\, or infrastructure.\

  microbes\, ALICE uses the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) as a communications p
 latform. MFCs are an organic energy source powered by microbes which facil
 itate contact between humans and microbes through electrical exchanges. Th

DESCRIPTION:When I first watched Hackers in 1998\, the idea of being able 
 to remotely control ships seemed rather fanciful. After working on contain
 er ships as an engineer in the mid-2000s\, it seemed every more unlikely. 
 We didn't have a full-time Internet connection and all the vital systems w
 ere truly air-gapped. But things have changed - ships are becoming more an
 d more connected and complex. \n\nAs a result\, 15 years later\, I found m
 yself sat in my pants on the sofa with the ability to control the steering
  on one of the world's largest cruise ships. We've been able to brick ever
 y PLC across tens of oil rigs\, pay for food as the captain\, and write ru
 de words on the side of the ship. \n\nTo get to this point\, we had to go 
 on a learning voyage across tens of different vessels\, including offshore
  support tugs\, super yachts\, oil rigs and container ships. Join me on a 
 whistle stop tour of what's on a ship\, how it's all connected together\, 
 what threats there are and how we find the vulnerabilities. Lots of little
  tips and tricks that can help anyone examine industrial control systems\,
  understand how they work\, and then have a lot of fun with them!\n\nTesti

DESCRIPTION:Come a long and learn about the history and art of DJ'ing.  Ge
 t hands-on with your first vinyl record mix on a set of Citronic mono reco
 rd decks made in England in the the 80’s with tunes from a kids disco at
  around that time. Try scratching records on a set of Technics SL1210’s 
 and then get hands on with your own device and learning digital DJ skills 
 and techniques.\n\nWe will primarily use Mixxx software for the workshop a
 s it's so awesome as well as being open source and free\, but other free o
 ptions for tablets and phones are all possible. There will also be an oppo
 rtunity to plug into a USB Mixer/controller and demo your new skills at th
 e end! The ultimate aim of this workshop is to introduce some basics of DJ
 'ing. The kids also have the exciting option to DJ at their own Kids Disco
  later in the evening at 7:30pm!  Royalty free music will be available alo
 ng with other guidance and options.\n\nPlease ask kids to wash hands prior
  to workshop and kids will also be asked to use hand sanitizer before touc
 hing shared DJ kit (if this is a concern don’t worry\, just take part in
  the workshop using your device that you brought). I will clean kit in bet
 ween kids having a shot. Really grateful for patience and understanding.\n

DESCRIPTION:Creative coding practices like live coding/algorave are often 
 described by the media as being of the future. For example in 2019\, wired
  magazine introduced live coding with the headline “DJs of the future do
 n’t spin records\, they write code”\, despite publishing very similar 
 articles previously in 2013 (“Hacking meets clubbing with the Algorave
 ”) and 2006 (“Real DJs Code Live”). In reality\, live coders are not
  DJs and are not trying to replace them! Live coding is just another way o
 f making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.\
 nSo this talk is about the _past_ of live coding\, rather than the future 
 -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving an
 d braiding are classic examples\, highly developed algorithmic crafts foun
 d all round the world\, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look '
 heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns\, juggling patterns\, konn
 akol vocal patterns\, and kollam drawings\, and equivalent contemporary pr
 actices like bytebeat\, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.\nIn the end we'
 ll ask\, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former? In
  particular\, what do contemporary 'digital' artists have to learn from cr
 aft-based heritage algorithmic artforms?\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.or

 ways been like that. In this talk I will introduce the basics of railway s
 ignalling\, and look at how it has evolved over time - often in response t

 a problem for the railways\, and how signalling systems are designed to de
 al with the inevitable human error. Working from the early days of the rai
 lway to the present (and future)\, the talk will take you through a number
  of accidents\, their causes and the improvements that were made after the
  accidents.\n\nThis talk is suitable for any level of knowledge about rail
 ways - it aims to be understandable for complete beginners\, and still hav
 e some interesting parts even for railway geeks.\n\nLink: https://www.emfc

  tip for when to take risks in board games and in life*. I will give an in
 sight into how Google's AlphaGo AI chooses its next move\, and give an exa
 mple of a game that seems biased against you\, but you actually have a sli
 ght advantage.\n2. *Teaching a robot to tell jokes*. I will introduce the 
 concept of factor graphs and describe an application of them to joke gener
 ation.\n3. *The twitter bot that is playing the longest possible game of c
 hess*. The World Chess Federation has some rules to prevent games from goi
 ng on forever. I will outline a proposal by Tom Murphy VII for the longest
  possible legal chess game\, and show the Twitter bot that I made to celeb
 rate this achievement.\n4. *A little theory of abundant numbers*. Abundant
  numbers\, e.g. 12\, 60\, 360\, are useful as they have many factors. I wi
 ll show you how common these numbers are and how to find them.\n\nLink: ht

DESCRIPTION:Mathematicians of yesteryear\, with limited access to computin
 g\, solved difficult problems by a combination of genius\, vivid imaginati
 ons and hard work.\n\nIn those days\, human 'computers' were used to calcu
 late and tabulate the solutions to maths problems ranging from trigs and l
 ogs\, to astronomical\, nautical\, banking and insurance information etc. 
 However\, those human computing processes were laborious (thus expensive)\
 , and error-prone. The invention of mechanical and electrical computing de
 vices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage\,
  Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more
  cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays\, computers are immensely more powerf
 ul than they were in either Babbage’s or Turing’s time. We will descri
 be a few mathematical problems that computers can solve\, and present some
  of the key techniques\, such as step-by-step iteration\, recursion and Mo
 nte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools\, such as 
 calculators\, spreadsheets\, programming languages etc. These tools are th
 e present-day equivalents of Babbage’s and Turing’s machines\, and are
  available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathe
 matical problems in work and in life. We end the talk by briefly speculati
 ng upon whether computing has anything to say about the nature of our live
 s and of the universe itself.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/

DESCRIPTION:PAMAL_Group is a European artistic group\, composed of artists
 \, media theorists\, curators-restorers and engineers.\n\nTheir artwork "3
 615 Love" will be installed at EMF 2022. \n\nPAMAL_Group creates its own w
 orks from digital artworks that have disappeared or been severely damaged 
 due to the obsolescence of computer software and hardware. Its work seeks 
 to reveal the vulnerability of an art that is highly dependent on industri
 al logic. All the artworks that the collective reconstructs\, as close as 
 possible to the original materialities\, sometimes in a deficient way\, ar
 e treated as archives.\n\nThe artwork "3615 Love" is based on the reconstr
 uction of telematic materialities (videotex\, Minitel network\, etc.) and 
 the archive of works by Jacques-Elie Chabert and Camille Philibert (L'Obje
 t perdu\, 1985) and Eduardo Kac (Videotext Poems\, 1985-1986). The install
 ation "3615 Love" shows how fragile and vulnerable our digital environment
  - and a fortiori its artistic productions - is. \n\n\nLink: https://www.e

DESCRIPTION:Saturday 23:30 - 1h 29m - 16+\n\nOne of those films that slack
 s your jaw in the first five minutes and then it just gets worse. The Bark
 ley Marathons is a documentary on the now-famous ultramarathon that takes 
 place every year in Tennessee. Participants aim to complete five laps of a
  twenty-mile course through the woods that has no proper trail\, using map
 s and compass. Some think the course is actually much longer. Even enterin
 g the event is a challenges with requirements being a closely guarded secr
 et. Every year\, 40 runners attempt to complete the course and usually\, n
 one succeed. A fascinating look into what drives people\, sometimes to the
  edge of sanity.\n\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/385-fi

  babies laugh so much more than the rest of us and what it tells us about 
 the human condition. I've written a whole book about this but to save you 
 reading it I will summarise the secret of babies happiness and reveal how 
 it fits in nicely with the best answers to the meaning of life. \n\nLink:

DESCRIPTION:On the surface of it it seems simple: tech and maker types hav
 e skills they enjoy using\, and community groups have unmet needs that cou
 ld be helped by these skills. Why then does it feel so incredibly hard to 
 make these collaborations happen in reality? And why does it feel even har
 der to do it while meaningfully fighting the Tories\, transphobes\, racist
 s\, and neo-Nazis?\n\nThis talk takes it back to the roots of why we are h
 ere and what we’re doing to explore why. I will break down how harmful n
 eoliberal methodologies that dominate tech groupthink such as Human Center
 ed Design and Design Thinking fundamentally restrict what can be made whil
 st presenting a cardboard cutout “ethics” that falls over at the sligh
 test touch.\n\nInstead I introduce Community Technology Partnerships\, a m
 ethodology developed at Geeks for Social change in collaboration with Manc
 hester School of Architecture\, based on “the capability approach”. Th
 is is a human development approach used by the UN and WHO developed by Mar
 tha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen that asks what people are able to *be* and *d
 o\,* and works to remove blockers to these concrete actions and states. Th
 is approach recentres community strengths at the centre of more holistic t
 ech interventions that restore power to the people who need it the most.\n

DESCRIPTION:Learn to sense the world without your eyes — hear walls and 
 corridors\, sense doorways and ceilings with your hair\, feel nearby walls
  and people on your skin. (Yes\, literally.) As a blind person\, I do this
  every day\; this is your opportunity to learn how to use sensory input th
 at you already have\, but you simply don’t realize or pay attention to.\
 n\nThis is specifically focused on blind navigation and sensory experience
 . I'll also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind perso
 n on the street\, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind pe
 rson\, real vs myth difficulties\, etc.\, but not blindness 101\, braille\
 , computers\, general life skills\, medical/legal issues\, or the like.\n\
 nCome in person. This isn't just a talk\; in the live audience\, you'll di
 rectly experience how to use senses you don't know you have\, with partici
 patory demonstrations tailored to the physical environment of EMF Camp\, b
 ased on the skills and stimuli relied on every day by blind people like me
 . Practice during camp\, and you'll sense more — permanently.\n\nYou'll 
 have a better experience if you wear short sleeves\, have your hair uncove
 red\, and come together with someone with whom you're comfortable exchangi
 ng brief touch on the cheek\, neck\, or arm.\n\nI will be completely blind
 folded for the entire talk. I won't see you nod\, shake your head\, wave\,
  or the like. Although I might be able to detect that if we're talking one
 -on-one\, I can't do so when you're in a crowd or at stage distance. I sti
 ll rely on live audience feedback\, so please respond audibly\, e.g. with 
 words or clapping.\n\nPer EMF request\, there's no Q&A during talk. Just f
 ollow me outside afterwards if you have questions or comments\, or join on
 e of the workshops.\n\n\n# Workshops\n\nI'll run hands-on workshops each d
 ay. By going for a walk with me around the camp — blindfolded\, using on
 e of my guide canes — you'll gain qualitative experience you can't get a
 nywhere else. \n\nSignup is now open: https://s.ai/emf/ws\n\n# Volunteers 
 needed\n\nI'll need assistants during the talk (on and off stage). No expe
 rience necessary — but brief training beforehand is\, preferably Thursda
 y (day 0) evening. Especially helpful if you have experience in aikido or 
 similar martial arts\, and are willing to be my on-stage uke during the ta

SUMMARY:Hacking Alchemy: Turning Household Materials into Gold

DESCRIPTION:Turning ordinary materials into precious silver or gold has be
 en the ultimate goal of alchemy for centuries. The mythical "Philosopher's
  stone" was thought to be the missing key needed for that\, but much to th
 e disappointment of generations of alchemists\, the elusive Stone was neve
 r found\, and the promise of unlimited wealth remained a dream. Until less
  than a century ago. \n\nWhen British physicist James Chadwick discovered 
 the nature of the neutron in 1932\, it soon became apparent that these sub
 atomic particles can change the composition of an atom's nucleus. By addin
 g neutrons to a nucleus\, or removing neutrons from a nucleus\, the atom c
 an be made unstable and forced to undergo changes\, now known as radioacti
 ve decay. These nuclear reactions can change an isotope of an element into
  another isotope of the same element\, or even into an entirely different 
 element. By choosing nuclear reactions and decays carefully\, it becomes p
 ossible to turn other materials into gold. Traditionally\, nuclear reactio
 ns require a very large and expensive nuclear reactor or particle accelera
 tor\, but a clever hacker doesn't need any of these! \n\nThis workshop sta
 rts with a 30 minute entry level introduction to nuclear physics to explai
 n attendees the scientific principles of elemental transmutation. Attendee
 s then build together their own Philosopher's stone with components that c
 an be found in any hardware store\, and finally use it to transmute (a few
  atoms) of liquid mercury into gold. After the workshop\, attendees have t
 he option to take their creation home.\n\nAttending this workshop will cos
 t: Free\, but donations are appreciated.\nSuitable age range: 16+\nAttende
 es should bring: It's helpful to bring a laptop or tablet to follow assemb
 ly instructions at your own pace.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedul

DESCRIPTION:I'm an artist creating interactive installations. The hardest 
 part is devising open-ended interaction\, spaces that invite people to rev
 eal their authentic selves\, and to connect with those around.\n\nBut tren
 ds in technology have gone in the opposite direction. Whether it's for usa
 bility\, profit\, safety\, profit or 'sparking joy'\, or profit (it's usua
 lly profit)\, 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s. Human
 -Computer Interaction has become a very planned affair. And the more plann
 ed it gets\, the less room there is for the ambiguous messy bits that make
  us human.\n\nCould it be another way? Presenting... \n✯✯✯ Rewilding
  Human-Computer Interaction ✯✯✯\nwhere\, instead of designing microm
 anaged user experiences\, we create open-ended spaces that embrace the unk
 nown\, the messy and the human. The ills of the online world are not probl
 ems inherent to its users but to systems that prevent those users from exi
 sting fully as humans. The solution is not more design\, but more wildness
 .\n\nSoapbox aside\, I do have a speculative project to share on this fron
 t.\n\nIn a collaboration with artist/AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas\, we'v
 e been training Variational Autoencoders on improvised dance\, and from th
 ese devising personalised interfaces that respond to creative movement. Th
 e resulting system allows you to move through a 16-dimensional parameter s
 pace while following the intuitions of the body. As an entangled black box
  system\, I can't explain how to use it\, but it can be learnt by the body
  through exploration and play.\n\nWe have it here at EMF as in Latent Voya
 ge\, letting you navigate the hallucinatory latent space of an image gener
 ating AI.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/220-rewilding-hum

DESCRIPTION:At this workshop we will be using strings or cord to make cros
 s body carrier for your water flask in macrame technique. \n\nThe Art of k
 not-tying dates back several centuries. It is believed that the word macra
 me is derived from the Arabic macramia which means "ornamental fringe". Ma
 crame was first brought by Arabs to Spain and after spread from Spain to I
 taly and eventually to the rest of Europe. Sailors played a large role in 
 keeping Macramé alive and sharing the art with new lands. Knots had many 
 practical uses aboard their ships and decorative knot-tying kept hands and
  minds occupied during long voyages.\nModern macrame is having a huge revi
 val. The repetitive tying of knots is soothing and meditative and great fo
 r mindfulness. It is also a craft that requires very little – just cord 
 and scissors. There are few basic knots in macrame and\, once you have mas
 tered them\, the possibilities of what you can create are endless.\n\nDuri
 ng the workshop we will create a crossbody water flask holder/carrier usin
 g cotton string.\nThe basic model requires about 15 meters of cord and aro
 und 60 knots in total - cotton cord and the printed instructions will be p
 rovided. The project can be completed in under two hours. Participants can
  keep and take home their creations.\n\n\n\nAttending this workshop will c

DESCRIPTION:Ionizing radiation\, resulting from nuclear reactions or radio
 active decay\, is invisible to the human eye yet it is all around us. Whet
 her it's coming from space\, from radioactive elements in the Earth\, or f
 rom human activity\, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere w
 e go\, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha\, beta\, 
 or gamma radiation is happening all the time\, and curiously\, some object
 s in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods\
 , camping gas mantles\, smoke detectors\, granite table tops and even bana
 nas\, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies
 .\n\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-Müller tube\
 , a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation\, the in
 ert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These 
 charges can be detected using an electronic circuit\, and visualised or se
 nt to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with
  radioactivity in popular culture.\n\nIn this workshop\, attendees learn a
 bout the different types of ionizing radiation\, and proceed to build thei
 r own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-Müller tub
 e. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This
  requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built\, attendees c
 alibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. At
 tendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.\n
 \nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable age range: 10+\nAttendees 
 should bring: Bring a solder iron if you can\, a laptop or tablet is also 
 helpful. Workshop is free\, but donations are appreciated.\n\nLink: https:

DESCRIPTION:Null Sector's DJ Narq\, aka Reflex of Grasshopper D / Eltech /
  Darq / Howlistic presents a two hour protracker extravaganza!\n\nProtrack
 er was the standard tool for making computer game music on the Commodore A
 miga home computers of the 80s and 90s.  Using 4 channels of 8-bit sampled
  sound and a maximum of around 1MB of ram\, making something sound good re
 quires a few tricks.\n\nI'd like to share the mystery and wonder of Protra
 cker - the Esperanto of tracker software - to a wider audience. \n\nIn thi
 s workshop we'll demonstrate:\n\nhow to sample your own sounds\nhow to rip
  samples from other peoples mods\nwhere to find decent mods\nhow to remix 
 mods\nhow to edit samples using amiga software\nhow to loop samples cleanl
 y\nhow to make protracker patterns\, and then assemble patterns into a son
 g.\n\nYou can follow along with a laptop and headphones!  You'll just need
  to install fs-uae (https://fs-uae.net) on linux or mac\, or winuae (https
 ://www.winuae.net/) on Windows **before** the workshop.  We'll be using Pr
 oTracker 2.3d from back in the day\, or ProTracker 2.3f which is a recentl
 y bugfixed version.  https://github.com/8bitbubsy/pt23f\n\nIf you've never
  seen a tracker\, it's like a spreadsheet where each row plays a bunch of 
 sounds.  Load a few samples\, start it recording\, and you can quickly mak
 e fun and catchy patterns using instruments\, speech\, singing\, or drum l
 oops.\n\nAbout your instructor.\n\nI was exposed to mods and amiga game mu
 sic in the early 90s and my mind was thoroughly blown.  Through cover disk
 s and PD (public domain) libraries I discovered Med\, Sound Tracker\, and 
  Octamed\, all classic trackers.  But it was in 1993 when I joined the Ami
 ga demoscene as a young teen that my eyes\, ears\, and mind were really op
 ened.  Donning the handle Reflex\, I first joined a group called Eltech an
 d then later Grasshopper Developments\, two mid-tier demogroups of the UK 
 scene. Protracker was the standard that literally everybody on the scene u
 sed. I didn't release tons of stuff back then\, but I was horse famous for
  a bit with some cheeky chip tunes and sampled songs about grasshoppers.\n

 ees should bring: Laptop with an amiga emulator installed.\n\nLink: https:
