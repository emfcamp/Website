But how does this look like in reality?\r\n\r\nIf you drop by with a Laptop running Kali-Linux either from USB-Stick or from within a virtual machine, I will walk you through the necessary steps. From analyzing the target system, finding exploits on it on to successfully hacking the \"victim\" using metasploit. And if you are quick enough and behave, we might even get so far as to remotely crash the system.\r\n\r\nThis is an introductionary level workshop targeted at a novice/beginner level audience that wants to learn how \"hacking\" actually works. InfoSec personel and other \"professionals\" attending this session will get shanghaied into supporting the other attendees. \r\n\r\nPrerequisites: Bring your own/a Laptop running a recent version of Kali-Linux inside a virtual machine or from a USB stick.",

    "description": "Learn to sense the world without your eyes — hear walls and corridors, sense doorways and ceilings with your hair, feel nearby walls and people on your skin. (Yes, literally.) As a blind person, I do this every day; this is your opportunity to learn how to use sensory input that you already have, but you simply don’t realize or pay attention to.\r\n\r\nThis is specifically focused on blind navigation and sensory experience. I'll also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind person on the street, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind person, real vs myth difficulties, etc., but not blindness 101, braille, computers, general life skills, medical/legal issues, or the like.\r\n\r\nCome in person. This isn't just a talk; in the live audience, you'll directly experience how to use senses you don't know you have, with participatory demonstrations tailored to the physical environment of EMF Camp, based on the skills and stimuli relied on every day by blind people like me. Practice during camp, and you'll sense more — permanently.\r\n\r\nYou'll have a better experience if you wear short sleeves, have your hair uncovered, and come together with someone with whom you're comfortable exchanging brief touch on the cheek, neck, or arm.\r\n\r\nI will be completely blindfolded for the entire talk. I won't see you nod, shake your head, wave, or the like. Although I might be able to detect that if we're talking one-on-one, I can't do so when you're in a crowd or at stage distance. I still rely on live audience feedback, so please respond audibly, e.g. with words or clapping.\r\n\r\nPer EMF request, there's no Q&A during talk. Just follow me outside afterwards if you have questions or comments, or join one of the workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Workshops\r\n\r\nI'll run hands-on workshops each day. By going for a walk with me around the camp — blindfolded, using one of my guide canes — you'll gain qualitative experience you can't get anywhere else. \r\n\r\nSignup is now open: https://s.ai/emf/ws\r\n\r\n# Volunteers needed\r\n\r\nI'll need assistants during the talk (on and off stage). No experience necessary — but brief training beforehand is, preferably Thursday (day 0) evening. Especially helpful if you have experience in aikido or similar martial arts, and are willing to be my on-stage uke during the talk.\r\n\r\nDetails: https://s.ai/emf#volunteer",

For the past year I've been helping to build an open source platform, which inverts the usual model by giving everybody (and every thing) their own place to store data and control who (and what) has access to it. This talk will give an overview of the platform and its underlying protocol, and illustrate how it can be used to build privacy preserving apps and Internet connected things. It will also cover how the platform can be self hosted on devices like the Raspberry Pi, and how people can get involved in the open source community growing around it.",

    "description": "Ionizing radiation, resulting from nuclear reactions or radioactive decay, is invisible to the human eye yet it is all around us. Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.\r\n\r\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-Müller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-Müller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.",

    "description": "Turning ordinary materials into precious silver or gold has been the ultimate goal of alchemy for centuries. The mythical \"Philosopher's stone\" was thought to be the missing key needed for that, but much to the disappointment of generations of alchemists, the elusive Stone was never found, and the promise of unlimited wealth remained a dream. Until less than a century ago. \r\n\r\nWhen British physicist James Chadwick discovered the nature of the neutron in 1932, it soon became apparent that these subatomic particles can change the composition of an atom's nucleus. By adding neutrons to a nucleus, or removing neutrons from a nucleus, the atom can be made unstable and forced to undergo changes, now known as radioactive decay. These nuclear reactions can change an isotope of an element into another isotope of the same element, or even into an entirely different element. By choosing nuclear reactions and decays carefully, it becomes possible to turn other materials into gold. Traditionally, nuclear reactions require a very large and expensive nuclear reactor or particle accelerator, but a clever hacker doesn't need any of these! \r\n\r\nThis workshop starts with a 30 minute entry level introduction to nuclear physics to explain attendees the scientific principles of elemental transmutation. Attendees then build together their own Philosopher's stone with components that can be found in any hardware store, and finally use it to transmute (a few atoms) of liquid mercury into gold. After the workshop, attendees have the option to take their creation home.",

Blockchains, crypto, and NFTs are trying to turn everything into something to be owned, attacking the very idea of the digital commons. And at the same time, they’re baking inequality into the system and unleashing a wave of hypercapitalist exploitation of the vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIs this really what we want?

    "description": "Using end of life or 'scrap' EV & Hybrid parts and opensource firmware I'm making an electric motorbike, having got tired of making dirty diesel ones! \r\n\r\nThe scrapyards are now filled with slightly broken EVs and Hybrid cars, and almost no one knows what to do with them. As a result the parts they are made from are very affordable and available for repurposing and hacking into your own projects.\r\n\r\nThe project is far from complete so there is nothing to bring to the show as I was hoping but there is lots to talk about and discuss regarding the state of play of hacking scrapped and discarded power inverters. \r\n  \r\nThe motorbike project uses a battery from a BMW i3 electric car, the motor is from a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV & the main power inverter for driving the motor is from a hacked Prius running open source firmware with the motorcycle running gear from used motorbikes and a whole host of other bits connected together in ways never intended.\r\n\r\nThe project is only possible using the work done by the EV car hacking community Openinverter.org and their community forum which have reverse engineered the EV power controllers allowing you to run open source firmware on them with some minor alterations.

Since then, these Astro Pis have run thousands of programs written by young people across Europe as part of the annual European Astro Pi Challenge (EAPC)\r\n \r\nIn 2021, after over two years of work, Space-X 24 took two new Astro Pis to the Space Station, where they have now been installed and, by the time EMF happens, will have been used to run even more exciting experiments designed by young people. \r\n \r\nThis talk will reveal behind-the-scenes details of the design, development and flight certification processes, including the manufacture of the space-grade aluminium flight cases, EMC testing, astronaut-friendly software engineering, and the issues that almost stopped the project. \r\n\r\nI’ll also describe some of the amazing experiments that have been designed and run by young people who take part in this year’s EAPC, and look at how they’ve used the new hardware including the IR sensitive camera and Machine learning Accelerator dongle. This will include photos taken as part of the Earth Observation experiments.\r\n\r\nThere will be Astro Pi ground units  (both Mark I and Mark II) on display",

    "description": "Null Sector's DJ Narq, aka Reflex of Grasshopper D / Eltech / Darq / Howlistic presents a two hour protracker extravaganza!\r\n\r\nProtracker was the standard tool for making computer game music on the Commodore Amiga home computers of the 80s and 90s.  Using 4 channels of 8-bit sampled sound and a maximum of around 1MB of ram, making something sound good requires a few tricks.\r\n\r\nI'd like to share the mystery and wonder of Protracker - the Esperanto of tracker software - to a wider audience. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop we'll demonstrate:\r\n\r\nhow to sample your own sounds\r\nhow to rip samples from other peoples mods\r\nwhere to find decent mods\r\nhow to remix mods\r\nhow to edit samples using amiga software\r\nhow to loop samples cleanly\r\nhow to make protracker patterns, and then assemble patterns into a song.\r\n\r\nYou can follow along with a laptop and headphones!  You'll just need to install fs-uae (https://fs-uae.net) on linux or mac, or winuae (https://www.winuae.net/) on Windows **before** the workshop.  We'll be using ProTracker 2.3d from back in the day, or ProTracker 2.3f which is a recently bugfixed version.  https://github.com/8bitbubsy/pt23f\r\n\r\nIf you've never seen a tracker, it's like a spreadsheet where each row plays a bunch of sounds.  Load a few samples, start it recording, and you can quickly make fun and catchy patterns using instruments, speech, singing, or drum loops.\r\n\r\nAbout your instructor.\r\n\r\nI was exposed to mods and amiga game music in the early 90s and my mind was thoroughly blown.  Through cover disks and PD (public domain) libraries I discovered Med, Sound Tracker, and  Octamed, all classic trackers.  But it was in 1993 when I joined the Amiga demoscene as a young teen that my eyes, ears, and mind were really opened.  Donning the handle Reflex, I first joined a group called Eltech and then later Grasshopper Developments, two mid-tier demogroups of the UK scene. Protracker was the standard that literally everybody on the scene used. I didn't release tons of stuff back then, but I was horse famous for a bit with some cheeky chip tunes and sampled songs about grasshoppers.",

Using videos & photos of the exhibit we also go into an explanation of how the aerodynamics, structures, performance and systems topics make the wing what it is.\r\n\r\nFor over a century, Bristol has been at the forefront of aeronautical and space technology, breaking boundaries to create the fastest, the biggest and the highest. Aerospace Bristol entertains & informs visitors with stories of human endeavour, individual genius and ordinary people achieving extraordinary things.",

    "description": "Mathematicians of yesteryear, with limited access to computing, solved difficult problems by a combination of genius, vivid imaginations and hard work.\r\n\r\nIn those days, human 'computers' were used to calculate and tabulate the solutions to maths problems ranging from trigs and logs, to astronomical, nautical, banking and insurance information etc. However, those human computing processes were laborious (thus expensive), and error-prone. The invention of mechanical and electrical computing devices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays, computers are immensely more powerful than they were in either Babbage’s or Turing’s time. We will describe a few mathematical problems that computers can solve, and present some of the key techniques, such as step-by-step iteration, recursion and Monte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools, such as calculators, spreadsheets, programming languages etc. These tools are the present-day equivalents of Babbage’s and Turing’s machines, and are available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathematical problems in work and in life. We end the talk by briefly speculating upon whether computing has anything to say about the nature of our lives and of the universe itself.\r\n",

But it wasn't always quite that way...\r\n\r\nThis talk will be a potted history of the safety of the railways in the UK and Ireland, starting from the early days when signalling was thought of as an inconvenience, and anything with wheels on it which sort-of went round went on the track. Eventually, the railway companies learned the benefits of adopting safer methods of working (sometimes requiring some encouragement from the law), leading to the introduction of some Victorian methods we still use today. Finally, we look at the more modern era with the railway losing its way with privatisation, and onto the current time, where computers and paperwork solve everything. Perhaps.\r\n\r\nFeaturing: Swiss Cheese, Charles Babbage vs. Brunel, working too hard, forgetting where you put your trains, losing your religion, a dark and stormy night, drunken driving, a loose screw, shifting foundations, and more.\r\n\r\nNo previous knowledge of the rail industry is required.

    "description": "In 2009 a TED Talk by David Merrill showed small interactive tiles that talked to each other; an MIT “what if” project from their media lab. Little IoT devices that brought computers, toys and board game pieces together. In 2011(version one) and 2012 (version 2) a commercial version, Sifteo Cubes, was released, but I was unaware, thinking the dream prototype was just that, a dream not a reality. They passed me by…\r\n\r\n In 2014, the v2 software was open sourced - the inevitable precursor to failure - and the company bought by Drone/Robotics developer for the obvious design skills of the Sifteo team; they had, after all, reverse engineered and reapplied wireless keyboard controllers into one of the coolest toys ever! So, I came to them late. Too late. By 2015, the server the control software required, along with the online marketplace for the dozen or so games that were made, were long gone. The Sifteo cubes I’d just (re)discovered from a desperate eBay sale were now just useless, battery powered bricks. And they didn’t even click together!\r\n\r\nBut I was stubborn. I wanted them to work. These little marvels of engineering and educational design. I had some of the software, a couple of the games, and none of the knowledge. Here’s how I managed to resurrect a legend, who I met, what some of them stole from me, and what I learned on the way",

    "description": "Many people believe that books are becoming obsolete, and that rare book libraries have little to contribute to modern society. Others love books, but may not consider themselves \"real collectors\" because they don't fit the image presented in popular culture. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll go beyond the typical arguments for books (\"they smell good\", \"they're pleasurable to handle\") and discuss the more complex reasons old books matter, primarily how collecting them can inform scholarship and change the way we see the world. I’ll present examples of real book collections that ask and answer important social and historical questions; challenge the idea that book collecting is only for wealthy people who want to acquire status symbols; and provide practical advice on how to go from book buyer to book collector.",

    "description": "Over my time in academia, I've endured a number of existential crises whilst learning about the concepts within philosophy that are required in order to undertake academic research. I figured that, if I'm going to spend the rest of my life constantly questioning my existence and reality itself, why not share this experience with others, too? A problem shared is still a problem that keeps you awake at night staring into the abyss unable to function. But hey, at least now I'm not alone.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain these theories and share my recurrent episodes of screaming WHYYYYYYYY at the universe, I've collected a number of memes and references over the years to convey concepts such as what is it to 'exist', why the scientific method is just as 'made up' as anything else, how we define 'truth' and lots of other tasty things to create a pervasive, disjointed feeling that you just can't seem to shake. Join me in this journey and then we can all go and sit by the lake and have a good cry / scream / rock back and forth because what does it all mean and what even is real anyway and I'm off to go eat a cake because while I can't actually prove if the cake is a lie or not I'm convinced it is damn tasty and I NEED TO FEEL SOMETHING OTHER THAN THIS EXISTENTIAL UNCERTAINTY FOREVER OKAY?",

How about that awkward silence in a big group where nobody wants to go first, the terror of going in a circle and being expected to be able to contribute at just that moment when it is your turn? \r\n\r\nThere is a better way, and it is easy and fun.\r\n\r\nIn this highly interactive workshop, y'all get to experience and practice simple recipes for structuring interactions that include and involve everyone. \r\n\r\nCome as you are and experience some intercation. Or learn more about the principles and micro structures for these \"group interaction recipes\" at liberatingstructures.com.\r\n\r\n",

I will give an insight into how Google's AlphaGo AI chooses its next move, and give an example of a game that seems biased against you, but you actually have a slight advantage.\r\n2. *Teaching a robot to tell jokes*. I will introduce the concept of factor graphs and describe an application of them to joke generation.\r\n3. *The twitter bot that is playing the longest possible game of chess*. The World Chess Federation has some rules to prevent games from going on forever. I will outline a proposal by Tom Murphy VII for the longest possible legal chess game, and show the Twitter bot that I made to celebrate this achievement.\r\n4. *A little theory of abundant numbers*. Abundant numbers, e.g. 12, 60, 360, are useful as they have many factors. I will show you how common these numbers are and how to find them.",

    "description": "\"The Enigma Machine was an electro-mechanical device used in the mid-20th century to encrypt communications. An ingeniously simple and elegant combination of cogs, wires and lamps, all fitting into a portable case, it provided some of the strongest encryption possible at the time. During various Covid-19 lockdowns, I decided to re-enact this important development in the history of computing, through a project to build an Enigma machine at home, using modern components and digital design techniques. The completed project is made out of cheap hobby electronics parts and laser-cut wood, and can be assembled entirely by hand, with no gluing, screwing or soldering. I will reflect on what this process taught me about the challenges of electromechanical computing, security and usability, the changes in modern manufacturing and supply chains, and their impact on computing. This will be followed by a Q&A and a demonstration where you can see the home-made Enigma machine in action and have a go at encrypting and decrypting a message.\"",

    "description": "Geoff, an autonomous 4WD robot, was conceived at the beginning of 2018 with the specific goal of roaming around the EMF campsite. While he did make an appearance that year, RGB lights dazzling in the dark, our ambitions for autonomy were thwarted.  However, with the arrival of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano in 2019 our artificial intelligence powered rover idea came to life.  After surviving his own brush with Covid-19, and nearly becoming a South African Nurse. Four years on, Geoff is back, and he's living his best life. \r\n\r\nThis talk delves into the highs and lows from over 4 and a half years of development: \r\nDesigning a custom Motor Controller, \r\nCannibalizing a CCTV pan & tilt unit to build an expressive head and utilising suspension components from an RC car, \r\nBurning out motors and eating gears, it took some perseverance with a dash of curiosity to get right, \r\nDriving hundreds of LEDs in amazing patterns, \r\nIntegrating a NVIDIA Jetson Nano (and then Xavier NX), \r\nHis \"hunger\" for Oranges, \r\nNearly becoming a robotic nurse in South Africa Covid-19 wards, \r\nComplete redesign of electrical systems, \r\nIncreasing capability with new sensors and 4 wheel steering drivetrain, \r\nDeveloping software across different systems, including FreeRTOS, ROS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Arduino, AWS Sagemaker and more… ",

    "description": "The speaker works for a small company in the UK who have developed a VTVL (Vertical Take-off, Vertical Landing) rocket, also known as a hopper or lander. This started as a student / hobby project and is now receiving funding from the European Space Agency (ESA.) There are lots of interesting technical problems involved in making a VTVL rocket work. You need to steer the rocket engine and control its thrust based on data from a variety of sensors. This involves mechanical, electronics and coding challenges. When fully developed, the test vehicle we've developed will be used to test software and hardware that enable robots to land safely on other planets such as Mars.\r\n\r\nThe talk will start with an introduction to rocket engines and a simple explanation of the vehicle's dynamics then cover the development of our VTVL rocket from hobby project to successful flying test-bed. It will include video footage of recent test flights where the rocket takes off and hovers on a tethered test rig.\r\n",

Despite this short lifetime, a homebrew community formed, has not gone away, and has only become more passionate since. \r\n\r\nThe most tangible demonstrations of this passion are the extensive hardware modifications that have been developed by hobbyists to drag the Dreamcast kicking and screaming in to the 21st century. Users can restore internet connectivity, replace the PSU or the commonly-failing disk drive (originally based on bespoke optical media), and even enable true digital video output. \r\n\r\nI will talk about the origins of the Dreamcast homebrew scene, and the development and implementation of the most popular of these mods that ensure the Dreamcast will live on for many years to come.",

Check https://s.ai/emf or Twitter @saizai or ask in person (I'm the one with hat, glasses, and two white canes).\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss — and practice — several very different meditation techniques, such as:\r\n• breath\r\n• empty mind\r\n• parallel concentration / stack overflow †\r\n• \"inner sanctum\" hypnotic induction ‡\r\n• movement\r\n• grounding & shielding / energy play\r\n\r\n† tends to work especially well if you find \"emptying your mind\" difficult (e.g. due to ADHD)\r\n‡ very simple, with script 100% disclosed beforehand — no silly stage tricks\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss several variants of the basic mechanisms, how to customise to your own preferences, and personal experiences (iff you choose to share) — but no religion, metaphysics, doctrine, or the like.\r\n\r\nPlease:\r\n• wear or bring something comfortable for sitting on grass/dirt\r\n• bring a drink & snack\r\n• pee and stretch beforehand\r\n• silence all electronics while at the workshop\r\n• do (only) what works for you\r\n\r\nI use scripts (with included variation suggestions) that work for most people, but not everyone. Please diverge from my instructions if something else feels right. That's common, and kinda the point — particularly for the hypnotic induction, which needs to be tailored to your own experience).\r\n\r\nLikewise, if something feels uncomfortable or triggering, please switch to a different meditation exercise instead (e.g. the basic breath meditation we start with).\r\n\r\nWhat you share is entirely up to you. I won't call on you. If there's something you'd only be comfortable sharing privately, please find and talk with me at another time.",

    "description": "At this workshop we will be using strings or cord to make cross body carrier for your water flask in macrame technique. \r\n\r\nThe Art of knot-tying dates back several centuries. It is believed that the word macrame is derived from the Arabic macramia which means \"ornamental fringe\". Macrame was first brought by Arabs to Spain and after spread from Spain to Italy and eventually to the rest of Europe. Sailors played a large role in keeping Macramé alive and sharing the art with new lands. Knots had many practical uses aboard their ships and decorative knot-tying kept hands and minds occupied during long voyages.\r\nModern macrame is having a huge revival. The repetitive tying of knots is soothing and meditative and great for mindfulness. It is also a craft that requires very little – just cord and scissors. There are few basic knots in macrame and, once you have mastered them, the possibilities of what you can create are endless.\r\n\r\nDuring the workshop we will create a crossbody water flask holder/carrier using cotton string.\r\nThe basic model requires about 15 meters of cord and around 60 knots in total - cotton cord and the printed instructions will be provided. The project can be completed in under two hours. Participants can keep and take home their creations.\r\n\r\n",

Life isn't perfect now, but it's a lot better despite the ongoing war and pandemic.\r\n\r\nI'm going to give you an overview of some of the things I've learned. It will be a mix of theory (what even are emotions?) and practical advice for understanding and engaging with your emotions better, with a pointer towards further reading  that will help you act on this advice better.",

In this talk I will introduce the basics of railway signalling, and look at how it has evolved over time - often in response to accidents and near-misses. You will find out how a single stray wire caused an accident that killed 35 people, why leaves on the line cause such a problem for the railways, and how signalling systems are designed to deal with the inevitable human error. Working from the early days of the railway to the present (and future), the talk will take you through a number of accidents, their causes and the improvements that were made after the accidents.\r\n\r\nThis talk is suitable for any level of knowledge about railways - it aims to be understandable for complete beginners, and still have some interesting parts even for railway geeks.",

    "description": "Over the past year or so, I've become way too interested in tracking London Underground trains with greater precision than anyone else so far. Transport for London provides an API (\"TrackerNet\") to get departure boards for all the stations -- but (ab)using that information to track the journeys of each individual train has proven much harder than expected.\r\n\r\nI'll explain how I built a system to squeeze useful insights out of an API not really designed to provide them -- including a fair few workarounds for TfL's capricious signalling systems, way more graph theory than I have any right doing, and why I now really hate the District Line. You'll be able to see how applying a carefully tuned pile of random maths lets me go from a chaotic jumble of data to a near-perfect model of the Tube map!\r\n\r\nI'll also cover the practicalities of running this system, explaining how I packaged it all up into a website people can actually use without getting banned by TfL for using their API too much or overloading the server I run it on.\r\n\r\nDon't let the mention of graph theory scare you off; this talk should be appropriate for all audiences, and should appeal to anyone with a casual interest in railways, open data, or infrastructure.",

The degree to which people can now pick and choose what they want in terms of (de)masculinizing and (de)feminizing effects/procedures is astonishing - even to many transgender people and medical professionals providing them care. Much of this customization is especially attractive to non-binary (neither strictly male nor female) individuals.\r\n\r\nFrom simply unbundling things that have historically been considered package deals to experimental surgeries and outright biohacking... come learn about the gender transition \"secret menu\", compared and contrasted with the traditional options.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\nSocial transition (briefly), including presentation, pronouns and name changes.\r\n\r\nMedical transition, including hormone replacement therapy, surgeries and specialized drug regimens.",

If you've heard of tidalcycles, it aims to be that for the web browser, re-implementing its cyclic approach to music composition, based on composing functions together. With just a couple of simple lines of javascript, you can be writing code that makes people dance, with immediate audio and visual feedback to help understand the code you've written.\r\nWe'll go through the basics of writing rhythmic sequences with the 'mini-notation', and how to transform them into mind-bending patterns by applying simple functions to them. By the end you'll be well on your way to your first algorave performance. \r\nNo pre-knowledge of code or music needed!",

    "description": "Creative coding practices like live coding/algorave are often described by the media as being of the future. For example in 2019, wired magazine introduced live coding with the headline “DJs of the future don’t spin records, they write code”, despite publishing very similar articles previously in 2013 (“Hacking meets clubbing with the Algorave”) and 2006 (“Real DJs Code Live”). In reality, live coders are not DJs and are not trying to replace them! Live coding is just another way of making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.\r\nSo this talk is about the _past_ of live coding, rather than the future -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving and braiding are classic examples, highly developed algorithmic crafts found all round the world, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look 'heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns, juggling patterns, konnakol vocal patterns, and kollam drawings, and equivalent contemporary practices like bytebeat, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.\r\nIn the end we'll ask, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former? In particular, what do contemporary 'digital' artists have to learn from craft-based heritage algorithmic artforms?\r\n",

    "description": "I'm an artist creating interactive installations. The hardest part is devising open-ended interaction, spaces that invite people to reveal their authentic selves, and to connect with those around.\r\n\r\nBut trends in technology have gone in the opposite direction. Whether it's for usability, profit, safety, profit or 'sparking joy', or profit (it's usually profit), 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s. Human-Computer Interaction has become a very planned affair. And the more planned it gets, the less room there is for the ambiguous messy bits that make us human.\r\n\r\nCould it be another way? Presenting... \r\n✯✯✯ Rewilding Human-Computer Interaction ✯✯✯\r\nwhere, instead of designing micromanaged user experiences, we create open-ended spaces that embrace the unknown, the messy and the human. The ills of the online world are not problems inherent to its users but to systems that prevent those users from existing fully as humans. The solution is not more design, but more wildness.\r\n\r\nSoapbox aside, I do have a speculative project to share on this front.\r\n\r\nIn a collaboration with artist/AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas, we've been training Variational Autoencoders on improvised dance, and from these devising personalised interfaces that respond to creative movement. The resulting system allows you to move through a 16-dimensional parameter space while following the intuitions of the body. As an entangled black box system, I can't explain how to use it, but it can be learnt by the body through exploration and play.\r\n\r\nWe have it here at EMF as in Latent Voyage, letting you navigate the hallucinatory latent space of an image generating AI.",

In this workshop you will design and build your own smart pillow, which when connected to your laptop, can be programmed to control your favourite streaming services. You will start by prototyping your design with paper circuitry and then will start sewing. Bring along your laptop and all other materials will be provided including an Arduino-compatible microcontroller and Trill capacitive sensor by Bela. No coding experience is needed, but some previous sewing experience will be helpful. If you don’t finish sewing your pillow in the workshop, you can take the necessary materials home with you.\r\n\r\nFull documentation, including Arduino library installation instructions you can follow ahead of time at: https://github.com/theleadingzero/smart-pillow/wiki",

    "description": "On the surface of it it seems simple: tech and maker types have skills they enjoy using, and community groups have unmet needs that could be helped by these skills. Why then does it feel so incredibly hard to make these collaborations happen in reality? And why does it feel even harder to do it while meaningfully fighting the Tories, transphobes, racists, and neo-Nazis?\r\n\r\nThis talk takes it back to the roots of why we are here and what we’re doing to explore why. I will break down how harmful neoliberal methodologies that dominate tech groupthink such as Human Centered Design and Design Thinking fundamentally restrict what can be made whilst presenting a cardboard cutout “ethics” that falls over at the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nInstead I introduce Community Technology Partnerships, a methodology developed at Geeks for Social change in collaboration with Manchester School of Architecture, based on “the capability approach”. This is a human development approach used by the UN and WHO developed by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen that asks what people are able to *be* and *do,* and works to remove blockers to these concrete actions and states. This approach recentres community strengths at the centre of more holistic tech interventions that restore power to the people who need it the most.\r\n\r\nNotes for this talk are here: https://gfsc.studio/emf22\r\n",

    "user_id": 1502,
    "description": "The hurdy-gurdy is an ancient musical instrument (10th century) with drones and melody strings bowed by a rotating wheel, played by pressing keys which contact them at different points. It featured in TV series such as “Black Sails” and “Walking Dead” as well computer games. A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds each and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes, they are loud. For pipers, practice e-chanters are available while nothing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation, with some internal electronics, for my own personal use to learn a few tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse, a website for sharing 3D printed ideas, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This open-source project has developed through many variations which I would bring to the talk, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gurdy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable keybox for travelling. It is an electronic device, with correctly placed keys, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications system for electronic musical instruments, via a USB cable to an attached or wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software. It is a low-cost way to enter the Hurdy Gurdy world and allows practice anywhere using headphones, thus preventing eviction or divorce!",

That original talk launched two sex tech hackathons, saw the UK host a conference, produced a book, and – nicest of all – contributed to the growth of a global community researching these things. There’s a few new things happening in the arena — but also very little progress on the hardware front. Why is that?

    "description": "Join a group of ecologists and digital tech nerds to discover what’s living in the river and what it means for the environment. We will be using eco-acoustic sensors to record underwater wildlife all weekend (linked to our planned installation). In this workshop, we will be getting into the river to try to find the creatures that we have (hopefully!) recorded. We’ll demonstrate techniques that can be replicated by anyone, anywhere, to give a quick indication of how healthy or polluted a river is. We will start by listening to our recordings to see if we can guess what we have found. We will then give a 15-min crash course on identifying eight types of invertebrates that can be found in rivers, each of which indicates different environmental conditions. Under the direction of workshop participants, our workshop leads will get into the river and collect some wiggly creatures. Everyone will count which species we have found and we will finish with a score that indicates how healthy or polluted the river is. If we have time, we will also demonstrate some simple tests to detect pollutants in the water. Participants will receive information to take home with them about different techniques that they can use to monitor river health for themselves, ranging from in-river surveys to Arduino sensor builds.\r\n\r\nWarning: We are not planning for participants to go in the water, but they may come into contact with the water so please cover up any cuts or broken skin.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot make our workshop time slot then do come across to our \"what's in the water\" village - we plan to be around at midday on Fri / Sat to run informal workshops.",

    "description": "Should we really be trying to make our tech indistinguishable from magic? Is there dark magic in tech? And what does that have to do with a teleporting duck in a classroom?!\r\n\r\nWe often hold creating 'a magical experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun, engaging, sometimes even playful, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological magic has a dark side too, especially when trying to help people learn and feel confident about technology.\r\n\r\nBy its nature, magic you experience is not under your control: it's a trick, and you're not supposed to be able to understand it; magic is inscrutable, and for many, that's disempowering.\r\n\r\nIn designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools, we've thought a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides of creating of a magical experience.\r\n\r\nThis talk will reflect on our struggle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.\r\n\r\nIt will explain how we attempt to present simple, understandable analogs of more complicated, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense confidence with the tech around them.  However, it will also look at how we've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make this all work nicely in a classroom.\r\n\r\nThrough this discussion we'll look in detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO, the way the micro:bit's USB interface works, the microphone privacy LED, the web-based compiler and the simple radio communication.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will look beyond micro:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can help us build better, more trustworthy tech.",

    "description": "In 1939 World War 2 started and the British Council—Britain's shiny new organisation for overseas cultural relations and propaganda—inherited the suddenly-closed tourist board's film-making department. Tourism films are no use in a war, so the Council turned their topics towards more cultural content as a softer kind of propaganda. Thus began a decade of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almost totally forgotten in Britain. \r\n\r\nBetween 1940–1950, the British Council produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain covering sports, manufacturing, landscapes, art, architecture, public healthcare, the justice system, democratic process, public institutions like the National Trust and the BBC, and more besides. \r\nA far cry from the Ministry of Information's rigid style, this collection features some of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (2001: A Space Odyssey, Cabaret, Superman), and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes). \r\n\r\nDistributed to over 100 countries worldwide, the films are stunning, dated, funny, and bizarre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides, optimistic cities, strong industry, forward-thinking social structures, and hardworking, happy people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that persists to this day... \r\nThat may not be a coincidence. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll cover the history and development of this film collection, how it was shaped, who saw the films, their staggering success, and their untold global legacy.",

Try scratching records on a set of Technics SL1210’s and then get hands on with your own device and learning digital DJ skills and techniques.\r\n\r\nWe will primarily use Mixxx software for the workshop as it's so awesome as well as being open source and free, but other free options for tablets and phones are all possible. There will also be an opportunity to plug into a USB Mixer/controller and demo your new skills at the end! The ultimate aim of this workshop is to introduce some basics of DJ'ing. The kids also have the exciting option to DJ at their own Kids Disco later in the evening at 7:30pm!

NASA funded an exploration of the concept for a giant space telescope back in 2014, but when I set out to make a practical experiment in 2018 there was only one other example I could find on the internet. \r\nI will give an introduction to what diffraction is, how it can be used in optics to do useful things like form images, why NASA might be interested, and how I made the experimental setup. I will also perform a live demonstration during the talk of both a simple aragoscope setup and some other diffractive optics (including rainbow chocolate, holograms and a camera that uses 35mm film as the lens! After the talk (and more importantly after dark!) I will also replicate a full demonstration of my Aragoscope experiment if weather allows.",

In fact, lots of the pages you visit on the internet are curated by algorithms that have learned what you like, or might buy.\r\n\r\nBut what's actually going on? And how do machines 'learn'?\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we'll use the BBC micro:bit to make everyday objects that you bring along, or people that you attach a device to, smarter with machine learning. Make a tennis racket that knows whether you've played a forehand or a backhand, or a shoe that knows whether you're walking or running. Or perhaps a device that can detect your dance moves.\r\n\r\nBy going through the whole process of collecting data, training a model and then testing the model, we'll demystify some of how machine learning works in the real world, and hopefully have some fun throwing micro:bits around doing it.\r\n\r\nWe're testing some new software for use with the micro:bit, and this is one of our first outings with it. Please come with the spirit of adventure. Families welcome as long as there are some members who are keen to lead the others!\r\n\r\nSuitable for children under 8 if helped by an adult.",

Join me and my PowerPoint to find out why cancer causes mobile phones (not the other way around), how stingy single people are about wine, and why Italian yoghurt adverts are a force to be reckoned with. You'll learn the truth about online dating, how not to create a pie chart, and the real cost of having a million dollars.\r\n\r\nFact Machine is a stand-up PowerPoint show exploring how, like some members of the mass media and political establishment, you can use facts and figures to prove anything you want—if, like said politicians and media types, you don’t worry too much about the small matters of “the truth” and “journalistic integrity”. Armed with a well-researched (and fully referenced) slideshow, I will take you on a journey through the minds of the statistically average single American: what they like, how they spend their time, and what they write when they leave online shopping reviews. Just don’t look too closely at how I apply the facts to reach my conclusions.\r\n\r\nExpect bad puns, even worse science, and the statistical key to getting yourself a date on the internet—if you’re willing to be a little “economical with the truth”.\r\n\r\nThis was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2019.",

    "description": "Join the conversation with Professors Rachel Armstrong and Ioannis Ieropoulos, and artist Julie Freeman, to hear about how the ALICE artwork is a springboard for thinking about a new infrastructure that encompasses nomadic lifestyles, smart plumbing, resource autonomy - moving beyond fossil fuels and working with natural energy flows.  This technology has global potential to disrupt energy and wastewater systems.\r\n\r\nActive Living Infrastructure: Controlled Environment (ALICE) is a \"living\" installation that communicates with microbes in real time by monitoring their electricity production so we can \"respond\" to them by feeding them with our liquid waste. Drawing together microbial metabolism, data, bioprocessor systems, artificial intelligence, low power electronics and digital displays, ALICE reveals the inner \"life\" and naturally-organised, imperceptible realm of microbes around us. To hold these digital \"conversations\" with microbes, ALICE uses the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) as a communications platform. MFCs are an organic energy source powered by microbes which facilitate contact between humans and microbes through electrical exchanges. The collected and analysed data can tell us about household resources, as microbes can give us information about our consumption, and reveal what we discard in our waste streams—while also powering our homes and, ultimately, cities.\r\n\r\nhttps://alice-interface.eu\r\n\r\nCome and see us in Null Sector!",

Its work seeks to reveal the vulnerability of an art that is highly dependent on industrial logic. All the artworks that the collective reconstructs, as close as possible to the original materialities, sometimes in a deficient way, are treated as archives.\r\n\r\nThe artwork \"3615 Love\" is based on the reconstruction of telematic materialities (videotex, Minitel network, etc.) and the archive of works by Jacques-Elie Chabert and Camille Philibert (L'Objet perdu, 1985) and Eduardo Kac (Videotext Poems, 1985-1986). The installation \"3615 Love\" shows how fragile and vulnerable our digital environment - and a fortiori its artistic productions - is. \r\n",

This session will give you a tour of what's happening in open source databases, from someone who lives the adventures of open source data in her day job. You will travel from the well-trodden paths of relational databases, through the leafy glades of time series, to the landmarks of search and document databases. This session is recommended for people with an interest in software who want to learn about the overall trends, license changes, rising stars, and which database technologies are here to stay.",

    "description": "When I first watched Hackers in 1998, the idea of being able to remotely control ships seemed rather fanciful. After working on container ships as an engineer in the mid-2000s, it seemed every more unlikely. We didn't have a full-time Internet connection and all the vital systems were truly air-gapped. But things have changed - ships are becoming more and more connected and complex. \r\n\r\nAs a result, 15 years later, I found myself sat in my pants on the sofa with the ability to control the steering on one of the world's largest cruise ships. We've been able to brick every PLC across tens of oil rigs, pay for food as the captain, and write rude words on the side of the ship. \r\n\r\nTo get to this point, we had to go on a learning voyage across tens of different vessels, including offshore support tugs, super yachts, oil rigs and container ships. Join me on a whistle stop tour of what's on a ship, how it's all connected together, what threats there are and how we find the vulnerabilities. Lots of little tips and tricks that can help anyone examine industrial control systems, understand how they work, and then have a lot of fun with them!\r\n\r\nTesting work is carried out in my role as Security Consultant at Pen Test Partners",

    "description": "This talk tells the extraordinary story of Muriel Howorth - science fiction author, choreographer, gardener and amateur nuclear physicist. Far away from the cares of Britain's Atomic Weapons Establishment, Howorth worked from her home in Eastborne in the early 1960s on an astounding DIY atomic experiment. Her aim was to solve world hunger. Sarah Angliss shares rarely seen archival material as she tells Howorth's story and considers the potential of citizen science and the perils of techno fixes for complex societal problems. This event may contain references to giant mutant vegetables. ",

If any of these are true, (or if you just want to build a robot), come and join us and construct a terrible fighting robot for the Hebocon tournament.\r\n\r\nHebocon is Robot Wars for those who are not technically gifted. The most successful robots are those which are truly ‘heboi’: pathetic, and constructed without the technology or skill that you’d usually expect.  Bad ideas and poor construction are the mark of success here, so you can create something free from the weight of any expectations.\r\n\r\nWe'll have some boxes of junk to rummage through for parts, but attendees are encouraged to bring their own materials too, the weirder the better*!\r\n\r\nThe actual hebocon tournament will be outside the bar on Saturday night at 6pm: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/351-hebocon-terrible-robot-fighting-tournament\r\n\r\n*nothing actually dangerous please",

But if you don't know what it is, or how you can use it to do all sorts of cool things, then this fun and easy workshop is for you.  \r\n\r\nArduino is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use.  It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes.  Yet, it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as well.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.  Participants will learn everything needed to play with electronics, and use a solderless breadboard to make a TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the workshop attendees get to take the TV-B-Gone they have built away with them.",

    "description": "Ionizing radiation, resulting from nuclear reactions or radioactive decay, is invisible to the human eye yet it is all around us. Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.\r\n\r\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-Müller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-Müller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.",

    "description": "UFO's, (recently re-branded UAP - Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), are an extremely strange subject, but not for the reasons you may expect.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that any reasonable person that takes the time to investigate their long, if rarefied, history concludes that they exist. I don't mean they exist in the obvious sense that a weird-looking shiny party balloon at a distance is an unified flying object that exists. No - for well over 70 years, hundreds of thousands of individuals have witnessed clearly visible flying craft - disk-shaped, cigar-shaped, triangles, \"Tic-Tac's\" - performing seemingly impossible aerodynamic feats in our atmosphere. That's just the start of it.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years, getting an overview of this inscrutable subject has been an unreasonable amount of effort for the average person. \"The Phenomena\" by James Fox, released in 2020, is a feature-length documentary film which gives a compelling, but sober, history of the subject. It has great production values, is very well sourced, and features interviews with extremely high-ranking individuals in intelligence, defence, aviation and governance as well as ordinary people with extraordinary evidence. Put simply, this film will leave you convinced that we are being visited by aliens.\r\n\r\nHang out afterwards for an informal discussion of what it all means, and tell us about your UFO sightings!",
