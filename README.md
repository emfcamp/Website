## Getting Started

The only supported way to develop is to use [Docker](https://docker.com/) with Docker Compose (on Linux you'll need to install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) separately).

[Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) is highly recommended
to monitor the containers.

To start all containers (and rebuild any which may have changed):
```
docker-compose build --parallel
docker-compose up
```
You should then be able to view your development server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

To create some fake data in your DB, run:
```
./flask dev data
```
To stop all containers, use `docker-compose stop`
To delete all data and start over fresh you can use `docker-compose down`.

Management commands can be listed and run using the `./flask` command, which
forwards them to the flask command line within the container.

### Tests

Tests are run using the `./run_tests` script.

### Code Style

For Python, we currently use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and
[flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) to enforce code style. These checks
are run by `./run_tests`.

However, it's easy to forget these checks, so you can also run them as a git
pre-commit hook using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To set this up on
the host where you'll be using git:
```
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Adding accounts

Once you've created an account on the website, you can use `./flask make_admin` to make your user an administrator.
Or, you can create an account and simultaneously make it an admin by using `./flask make_admin -e email@domain.tld`

E-mail sending is disabled in development (but is printed out on the console). You can also log in directly by setting BYPASS_LOGIN=True in config/development.cfg and then using a URL of the form e.g. `/login/admin@test.invalid` and navigate to `/admin/`.

### Database Migrations

- `./flask db migrate -m 'Migration name'` to generate migration scripts when models have been updated.
- `./flask db upgrade` to run any migration scripts you've generated.
- `./flask db downgrade` to undo the last migration.

For more migration commands, see the [flask-migrate docs](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
