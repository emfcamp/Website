#### Bank Transfer
These are manually resolved via scripts and the admin panel.

This is the easiest way to get unpaid tickets into the system, but there's currently no easy way to test reconciliation.

#### Stripe
This is the easiest method to "pay" for a ticket when you're developing. The details for a successful payment are:

- **email**: whatever you want
- **card number**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **expiry**: anything in the future, e.g. 12/34
- **cvc**: anything, e.g. 123

If you want to test specific modes please check [their documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing 'Stripe testing docs')

#### GoCardless
Unfortunately GoCardless don't offer a simple method of setting up a developer system. If you want to test this payment method you'll have to:

1. Make a copy of 'config/development.cfg' and name it 'config/live.cfg'
2. Set up your own merchant account (go to [https://gocardless.com/merchants/new](https://gocardless.com/merchants/new)).
3. Enable Sandbox mode (button at the top right)
4. Enable developer mode: 'More...' (top left) > Developer (this should take you straight to the [API Keys](https://dashboard-sandbox.gocardless.com/developer/api-keys)). 
5. Copy the following values from the API Keys to the appropriate environment variable in 'live.cfg':
    - 'App Identifier' -> `GOCARDLESS_APP_ID`
    - 'App secrets' -> `GOCARDLESS_APP_SECRET`
    - 'Merchant access token' -> `GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    - 'Merchant id' -> `GOCARDLESS_MERCHANT_ID`
6. From Developer go to [URI Settings](https://dashboard-sandbox.gocardless.com/developer/uri-settings) (left hand menu block)
7. Set the following:
    - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:5000/pay/gocardless/`
    - **Cancel URI**: `http://localhost:5000/pay/gocardless/`

In theory you should now be able to use GoCardless to checkout. You should see the payments under [payments](https://dashboard-sandbox.gocardless.com/payments) (top left)

To create a successful Direct Debit in the sandbox, use the [test bank details](https://developer.gocardless.com/getting-started/developer-tools/test-bank-details/):
- **Country**: UK
- **Sort code**: 20-00-00
- **Account number**: 55779911 or 44779911
- **Postcode**: any valid postcode, e.g. SW1A 1AA
- **City**: any value

For Euro accounts, use a country and IBAN from the [standard IBAN test list](http://www.voxstone.co.uk/IbanChecker.aspx), for example:
- **Country**: France
- **IBAN**: FR1420041010050500013M02606

- **Country**: Germany
- **IBAN**: DE89370400440532013000

- **Country**: Netherlands
- **IBAN**: NL39RABO0300065264

If you can't choose a country above the account number field or you get the error "scheme is not supported for your organisation", you need to get your account unlocked for Euros. Enter your sandbox email address at https://support.gocardless.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new and say you'd like SEPA payments enabled on your account.

You can force different results based on the first name. For more, check [their documentation](https://developer.gocardless.com/getting-started/developer-tools/scenario-simulators). These scenarios will play out via webhooks a minute or so after you complete the flow.

Test users
==========

Create test users with:

```./flask dev cfp_data```

and enable `BYPASS_LOGIN` in config. You can then log in using, e.g. `/login/admin@test.invalid` and navigate to `/admin/`.
