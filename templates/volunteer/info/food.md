# Food

As a thank you for volunteering, after each shift you complete you’ll be given a token which can be exchanged for a meal from the volunteer lounge. In most cases this will be given to you by the relevant team lead at the end of your shift, but if they’re otherwise occupied that might not be possible. If you do find yourself in that situation speak to the volunteering team, which can be found in the information tent, and they’ll make sure you get fed!

Please bring a bowl, plate and cutlery with you when coming for food. We will have disposable ones available but if you can bring your own that’ll help reduce waste.

The intended meal schedule is breakfast 07:00-09:00, lunch 12:00-14:00, dinner 18:00-20:00, but things don't always go to plan... We will announce meal times in volunteers IRC channel (#emfcamp-volunteers on libera), or you can ask at the volunteer desk.
