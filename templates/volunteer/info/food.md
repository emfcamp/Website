# Food

As a thank you for volunteering, after each shift you complete you’ll be given a token which can be exchanged for a meal from the volunteer lounge. In most cases this will be given to you by the relevant team lead at the end of your shift, but if they’re otherwise occupied that might not be possible. If you do find yourself in that situation speak to the volunteering team, which can be found in the information tent, and they’ll make sure you get fed!

All volunteers are also welcome to snacks and hot & cold drinks from the volunteer lounge at any time.

The intended meal schedule is breakfast 08:00-10:30, lunch 13:00-15:00, dinner 18:30-21:00, but things don't always go to plan, you can ask at the volunteer desk.
