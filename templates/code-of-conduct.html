  <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>We are committed to making Electromagnetic Field an inclusive and welcoming event
for everyone.</p>

<p>
   Sadly, technology events have a notorious reputation for harassment. We set these ground
   rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable, so
   that everyone can feel comfortable attending EMF.
</p>

<p>Everyone who attends is required to abide by this code of conduct, both at the event
   and on any online channels. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will not tolerate homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise
      prejudiced behaviour.</li>
  <li>We will not tolerate harassment. Stalking, sexualised imagery in public spaces,
      and physical contact or sexual attention without consent is harassment.
      Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
  <li>In this crowded event, every attendee's personal space is still their own. 
       If you are asked to leave someone alone, or to leave their village,
       you must respect this.</li>
  <li>We respect the wishes of attendees who do not want to be filmed or photographed.
        Don't publish photos or video where people are identifiable unless you have their permission.</li>
  <li>We will not engage in aggression or elitism &mdash; nobody should be afraid to ask questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you break these rules, we may expel you from the event without a refund in accordance with
<a href="{{url_for('payments.terms')}}">our terms of ticket sales</a>, and we may ban you from future EMF events.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct,
  you can get in touch with us in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find a member of event staff (they'll be clearly identifiable) and let them know.
  All our volunteer staff will be briefed on how to handle a harassment situation.</li>
  <li>Drop us an email at <a href="mailto:{{ config['DUTY_EMAIL'][1] }}">{{ config['DUTY_EMAIL'][1] }}</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any comments or queries, you can get in touch with our Conduct &amp; Accessibility team at <a href="mailto:{{ config['CONDUCT_EMAIL'][1] }}">{{ config['CONDUCT_EMAIL'][1] }}</a>.</p>
