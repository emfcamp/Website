<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p class="emphasis">
  We are committed to making Electromagnetic Field an inclusive and welcoming
  event.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
  Sadly, technology events have a notorious reputation for harassment. We've set
  these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behaviour is
  not acceptable, so that everyone can feel comfortable attending EMF. Everybody
  in the EMF community is required to abide by this code of conduct at the event
  and on any online channels.
</p>

<h3>The Rules</h3>

<p>
  We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, or discriminatory behaviour of any form.
  Specifically:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do not engage in homophobic, biphobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist,
    or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented physical contact, threatening
    behaviour, and unwanted sexual attention is harassment. Dressing or acting
    in a certain way is not consent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Everyone's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone
    alone, or to leave their village, you must respect this.
  </li>
  <li>
    People may not want to be filmed or photographed. You must have consent from
    anyone who is identifiable in a photo or video.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sexualised language and imagery is not appropriate in public, or in sessions
    which do not deal directly with such topics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Aggression and elitism are not welcome &mdash; do not belittle people for
    their knowledge or experience.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting an Incident</h3>

<p>
  If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct, you can
  get in touch with us by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Sending us an email at
    <a href="mailto:{{ config['CONDUCT_EMAIL'][1] }}"
      >{{ config['CONDUCT_EMAIL'][1] }}</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finding a member of event staff (they'll be clearly identifiable) and let
    them know. All our volunteer staff will be briefed on how to handle reports.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Response</h3>

<p>
  During an event, we aim to reach a decision on all conduct issues within 12
  hours. Outside of events, we will initially respond within one week.
</p>
<p>
  All reports will be taken seriously and will be considered in confidence by
  our Conduct &amp; Accessibility team with the involvement of the Directors and
  Duty Site Manager if necessary.
</p>

<p>
  If we believe you have violated this code of conduct, we will normally issue
  you with a warning, with which you are expected to comply. If your behaviour
  continues, we may eject you from the event and ban you from any online
  channels.
</p>

<p>
  Serious breaches, including sexual or physical assault, will result in your
  immediate ejection from the event and a ban from all future EMF events. We may
  involve the police if the victim wishes.
