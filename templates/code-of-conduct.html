<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p class="emphasis">
  We are committed to making Electromagnetic Field an inclusive and welcoming
  event.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
  Sadly, technology events have a notorious reputation for harassment. We've set
  these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behaviour is
  not acceptable, so that everyone can feel comfortable attending EMF. Everybody
  in the EMF community is required to abide by this code of conduct at the event
  and on any online channels.
</p>

<h3>The rules</h3>

<p>
  We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, or discriminatory behaviour of any form.
  Specifically:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do not engage in homophobic, biphobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist,
    or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not harass people. Harassment includes stalking, unconsented physical contact,
    threatening behaviour, and unwanted sexual attention. Dressing or acting
    in a certain way is not consent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Everyone's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone
    alone, or to leave their village, you must respect this.
  </li>
  <li>
    People may not want to be filmed or photographed. Respect their wishes when
    taking photos. Do not publish identifiable images of people without their
    consent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sexualised language and imagery is not appropriate in public, or in sessions
    which do not deal directly with such topics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Aggression and elitism are not welcome &mdash; do not belittle people for
    their knowledge or experience.
  </li>
</ul>

    them know. All our volunteer staff will be briefed on how to handle reports.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Our response</h3>

<p>
  During an event, we aim to reach a decision on all conduct issues within 12
  hours. Outside of events, we will initially respond within one week.
</p>
<p>
  All reports will be taken seriously and will be considered in confidence by
  our Conduct &amp; Accessibility team with the involvement of the Directors and
  Duty Site Manager if necessary.
</p>

<p>
  If we believe you have violated this code of conduct, we will normally issue
  you with a warning, with which you are expected to comply. If your behaviour
  continues, we may eject you from the event and ban you from any online
  channels.
</p>

<p>
  Serious breaches, including sexual or physical assault, will result in your
  immediate ejection from the event and a ban from all future EMF events. We may
  involve the police if the victim wishes.
