<h2>Sponsor Electromagnetic Field</h2>

            title="EMF 2022, Kari Bellamy" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="float:right; width:320px; margin-left: 16px;">
<p>Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is the UK’s largest technology-focused camping festival: a three-day event for people with an inquisitive mind and an interest in science, engineering, arts, technology, crafts, games, DIY, or security.</p>

<p>Held every two years, EMF is a cross between a conference and a festival, with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects. EMF is a non-profit event, entirely run by a dedicated team of volunteers.</p>

<p>In 2024 we'll be running the sixth EMF festival{# at <a href="http://eastnorcastle.com/visit-eastnor-castle/eastnor-deer-park/">Eastnor Castle Deer Park</a> in Herefordshire #}. We're providing a programme of three days of fascinating talks, workshops, and performances, to an audience of over 3000 attendees in an internet-connected field.</p>

<h3>Help Us Out</h3>
<p>Ticket sales provide for the basic EMF infrastructure, but we rely on partnerships
with generous sponsors to make the festival a truly amazing place to visit. This year,
we hope support from sponsors will make the following things possible:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Comprehensive, free on-site childcare and content for young people.</li>
    <li>Live transcription of talks.</li>
    <li>Large-scale interactive art installations.</li>
    <li>Funding for speakers and workshops who are otherwise unable to attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>We routinely work with sponsors to tailor their sponsorship package to an appropriate area.</p>

<p>Previous major sponsors have included <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.farnell.com/">Farnell</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a>, <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/">Mathworks</a>, <a href="https://www.nexmo.com">Nexmo</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://imgtec.com/">Imagination Technologies</a>.

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>The festival has rapidly grown in size, from just 400 attendees at the first EMF in 2012 to a predicted attendance of over 3000 this year.</p>

<p>EMF draws a broad spectrum of attendees from a large range of disciplines around the world. We actively aim to become more diverse with each event, seeking out new topics and speakers from underrepresented demographics. As a result we have a strong <a href="{{url_for('base.code_of_conduct')}}">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>A significant proportion of EMF attendees work in technology or related industries, however we encourage them to speak on topics unrelated to their careers. In 2014 we introduced our first young people's track, with dedicated activities for the under-13s and full childcare for under 10s.</p>

<p>We encourage sponsors to gift unused admission tickets to those who otherwise may not attend EMF.</p>

<h3>Getting The Most From Sponsoring</h3>
<p>EMF is not a typical technology event. There is no central hall, sponsor area, or place for roller banners - sponsors who get the most from the event often do so through active participation.</p>
<h4>Speaking & Facilitating Workshops</h4>
<p>We're looking for talks, performances, and workshops for all ages. Sessions should have wide appeal and not just be a vendor pitch, however we welcome you to think about novel content that includes your company's product, goal, or message.</p>
<p>You can submit in our <a href="/cfp">Call for Participation</a> or discuss including a proposal as part of a sponsorship package.</p>
<h4>Villages</h4>
<p>Around the camp attendees will pitch tents, often forming 'villages' of individuals with similar interests (a list of villages is shared with attendees). In it's most basic form - it's just a group of tents. However, villages will often coordinate and run activities in parallel to the stage schedules. What you do is up to you!</p>
<p>We can handle the hiring of a gazebo and furniture for your village if you wish discuss the cost of this as part of our sponsorship conversation.</p>
<h3>Sponsorship Levels</h3>
<p>The following sponsorship levels are presented as guidance, however we are happy to produce
    a custom sponsorship package for each sponsor that wishes to be involved with EMF.</p>
