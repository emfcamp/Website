    <h2>Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)</h2>

    <p>Electromagnetic Field 2020 has been <a href="https://blog.emfcamp.org/2020/03/25/emf-2020-cancelled/">cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>

    <p>We also recommend that Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) events be put on hold until it's possible to be confident in the safety of attendees, particularly indoors.</p>

    <p>We look forward to seeing future events when it is safe, so people can organize and plan projects for EMF 2022.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, get in touch at <a href="mailto:contact@emfcamp.org">contact@emfcamp.org</a>.</p>
