          Electromagnetic Field is a non-profit UK camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind or an
          interest in making things: hackers, artists, geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers.
        </p>
        <p>A temporary town of more than a two thousand like-minded people enjoying a long weekend of talks, performances,
        and workshops on everything from <strong>blacksmithing</strong> to <strong>biometrics</strong>,
        <strong>chiptunes</strong> to <strong>computer security</strong>,
        <strong>high altitude ballooning</strong> to <strong>lockpicking</strong>,
        <strong>origami</strong> to <strong>democracy</strong>,
        and <strong>online privacy</strong> to <strong>knitting</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>To help matters along, we provide <strong>fast internet</strong>,
           <strong>power to the tent</strong>, <strong>good beer</strong>, and
          <strong>amazing installations</strong>, entirely organised by a dedicated team of volunteers.
