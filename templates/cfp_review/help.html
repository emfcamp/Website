<h1>CfP Process Help</h1>

<p>This covers technical notes on how the CfP system works. If you're after guidance on how the CfP process works as a submitter you want <a href="{{ url_for('cfp.guidance') }}">the guidance page.</a>
<p>It mostly covers the process for submitted talks. Installations, workshops, youth workshops etc. etc. are organised by the relevant teams and are reviewed by them.

<h2>The process (for talks)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Submitted
  <li>Content check
  <li>Anonimisation &amp; reviewability check
  <li>Reviewed
  <li>Accepted/rejected/added to next round
  <li>Accepted talks scheduled
</ol>

<h2>How to review</h2>
<p>The aim of this review process is to select the most interesting talks and workshops in as an un-biased a way as we can. To that end all proposals are anonymised and we do blind selection of the best proposals based on how you vote.
<p>Proposals that are ready for you to review can be seen in the <a href="{{ url_for('.review_list') }}">review page</a>.
<p>It is split into two lists, 'requires review' and 'previously reviewed'.
<p>The order of proposals in the 'requires review' list is randomised to (hopefully) reduce first/last biasing. The order shouldn't change unless you delete your cookie.
<p>At the bottom is a button 'show some different proposals' which will re-randomise the proposals in your 'requires review' list.
<p>You'll see proposals in blocks of 30. You don't have to review everything but please aim to review at least 1 block of 30.
<p>For each un-reviewed proposal you have several options:
  <ul>
  <li>Vote (the three green buttons). The options are:
    <ol>
      <li>"Bad" something you don't think we should host that you wouldn't go to.
      <li>"OK" something interesting but not amazing that you might go to.
      <li>"Excellent" something amazing that you would definitely go to
    </ol>
  <li>"I can identify the submitter (do not vote)" (the red button) If you think you can identify the submitter please write who you think it is in the message box and click this button. This proposal will no longer be shown to you.
  <li>"I need more information" (the blue button) - if something in the proposal is unclear you can request clarification by filling in the message box and clicking the button.
</ul>
<p>While you're reviewing you'll be auto-advanced through this list so it's recommended to start from the top but not essential.

<h3>Changing your mind</h3>
<p>If you want to change your mind you can select previous proposal from "previously reviewed" and click "I'd like to change my response".

<h3>Feedback/Questions</h3>
<p>One final note: if you have any problems, comments and/or suggestions please <a href="mailto:{{ config['CONTENT_EMAIL'][1] }}">email</a>
