<h2>Food &amp; Drink</h2>
<p>There will be a variety of food vendors, the exact suppliers haven't been confirmed for this year yet, but last year alongside the usual festival food we had vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Doing a 3 hour <a href="/about/volunteering">volunteer shift</a> will allow you to enjoy a meal cooked by our excellent crew catering.</p>
<p>The Robot Arms will also be back, serving excellent ales, ciders, and non-alcoholic drinks.</p>

<h3>Bringing Your Own Food</h3>
<p>You are of course welcome to bring your own food and drink if you'd rather, but please keep in mind that all open flames must be kept elevated off the grass. If you can please also avoid bringing glass containers, broken glass is a pain to clear up.</p>
<p>If you need to resupply there's a Tesco in Ledbury, which is easily accessible via the shuttle bus.</p>
