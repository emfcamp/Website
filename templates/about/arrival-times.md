  <li>It closes at: <strong>Monday 3 June 12pm (midday)</strong></li>
</ul>

## More detailed times

**Thursday 30 May 10am** -- Gates open. You can be on site from now; it's intended for folks to have a chance to set up their tents, find one another and get comfortable.
**Friday 31 May 11am** -- Talks start on our stages.
**Monday 3 June 12pm (midday)** -- Site closes to the public.

## Set up & tear down

The site is not open before **Thursday 10am**. A number of people will be on-site before then setting things up (e.g. volunteers, villages and installations). To be on site during the set-up you must have organised it with us, and received confirmation, before you arrive. Please, do not turn up before Thursday unless we're expecting you.

Similarly, from **Monday midday** we will be tearing down the site and if you're still on-site, you will need to have arranged this with us.
