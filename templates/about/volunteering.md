# Volunteering at EMF
EMF is a non-profit event, entirely organised by volunteers. Nobody is paid to work on EMF, and everyone who volunteers pays for their own ticket. This includes the core organisers.

We’d like everyone to consider volunteering to help the event run smoothly, even if it is only for an hour or two.

## Before the event

Running an event like EMF requires a huge amount of planning to make sure the event runs smoothly. This starts a year or more in advance.

**We're looking for people to help organise the event**. If this is something that interests you [take a look at the sort of things we're looking for help with](/about/volunteer-roles).

## During the event

During the event, there are plenty of roles which need to be filled, from construction to cooking for volunteers.

Closer to the event, you’ll be able to log in to the volunteer system which allows you to sign up for shifts. Volunteers who complete a shift will receive a [delicious free meal from our volunteer kitchen](#volunteer-kitchen).

## Setup & teardown

We’re grateful for help setting up the event, and especially tearing it down.
If you want to help with either setup or teardown you will need a ticket to EMF and **permission from us to turn up early or stay after the event ends**. We do not allow under-18s on site during setup or teardown without explicit permission.

During setup and teardown, EMF is a construction site and we are liable for your safety. If you don’t follow instructions we will be forced to remove you from site, for everyone's safety.

If you’re on site for setup/teardown you have to help with everything - not just what you’re interested in. There’s plenty of lifting and shifting that requiring a degree of physical fitness and mobility. If you’re not actively helping, we will ask you to leave.

## <span id="volunteer-kitchen">Volunteer Kitchen</span>
The volunteer kitchen runs from buildup, during the event, and into teardown and provides volunteers with three hot meals a day as a thank you for helping out: each shift worked grants a volunteer one hot meal.
Our chefs cook a variety of delicious dishes from all around the world, suitable for a large range of dietaries, and will do their best to accommodate special requirements. If you have any dietary concerns, please let them know and they will work with you to find you something you can eat.

The kitchen is particularly in need of volunteers during buildup to help with cooking the meals for the buildup crew and preparing for the EMF rush. If you want to help out, please contact us!
