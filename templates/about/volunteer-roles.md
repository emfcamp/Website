# Pre-event Volunteer Roles
We're looking for people to fill the roles listed below, please keep in mind that all of them require a time commitment ahead of the event.

Some of the roles are new this year whilst others are portions of previous positions in order to lighten the load on other volunteers.

If any of these roles are of interest to you please send an email to [volunteers@emfcamp.org](mailto:volunteers@emfcamp.org) and introduce yourself. If you can't find a role that interests you but would still like to help, get in touch - we'll do our best to find something that you'll enjoy!

**The following teams currently need pre-event volunteers:**

* **Badge** - Electronics and software design for our unique camp badge
* **Site** - Getting the site built

## Badge Team
Responsible for designing, programming, and manufacturing the unique electronic camp badge produced for each EMF event. During the event the badge team also hosts workshops on how to use the badge, and assists people with issues.

### Firmware developer
Firmware developers build the base software that runs on the badge, generally working in C++/Python and targetting microcontrollers. You do not need to be a professional to help with this role. If you've got any experience with USB protocols such as U2F, CTAP2, CCID, or love cmake, we'd love to hear from you - but this is not required.

### Web developer
The badge team web developers work on the online app-store and development support tools so attendees can easily write code for the badge and experiment with other's code. We're looking for people with experience in web frontend technologies, python, and an eye for design & UX.

## Site Team
The site team is in charge of getting the power run, water running and tents up.

### Chippy/Carpenter
We need someone to make sure that various pieces of woodwork get done, in previous years this has included the frames for sinks, simple post boxes and pieces of the EMF sign. We idelly need someone who can supply their own tools and is able to be on site early.

**Do not show up early unless cleared by a team lead**
