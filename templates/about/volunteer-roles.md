# Volunteer Roles

It takes a wide variety of skills to make EMF happen, it's not all network cabling and designing badges. Ahead of the event, a lot of what needs doing is sending emails and project management. If you've got some spare time and would like to help please do [get in touch](mailto:volunteer@emfcamp.org).

In general we're looking for people ahead of the event who are comfortable with some of the following skills:

* Project management
* Supplier management & ordering
* Web development

We're also looking for people to fill the following specific roles:

## Arcade

Have you ever wanted to put together an arcade full of indie games? Ahead of time this role will mostly involve sending emails, and talking to people who might be interested in bringing their game to EMF. During the event you'd be looking after the arcade itself and possibly troubleshooting any problems that arise.

## Arts & Installations

The Arts & Installations team works with artists and makers to help them bring their work to EMF, reviewing CFP submissions to select the installations which attendees will enjoy, and making sure everything that's needed is in place. They also apply for grants which allow us to provide financial support. Some experience of building large installations would be helpful. Ideally you'd be able to arrive a few days early to help get installations set up.

## Copy Editor

We need someone to help us produce better copy. Particularly email copy for our ticket-holder emails the job will involve turning vague statements and bullet points in to coherant text that can be sent out to our attendees whilst preserving our (we hope) friendly voice.

## Music Team

The music team are looking for people to book artists to play, and to look after them once they arrive on site. An interest in music and the ability to remove brown M&Ms are a great help.

## Shop

The shop stocks a supply of festival essentials, including food, drink, t-shirts, and soldering irons. We're looking for a few more people to work with the team, planning what to stock in the lead up, and then once on site running a few shifts supporting the volunteers staffing the shop. If you've used Square to sell things before that would be great, but no experience is neccessary.


## Swap Shop

We're looking for someone to look after the swap shop, where people bring the random junk that's been sitting in drawers, and go home with some different random junk which just might get turned into something amazing. This will largely involve keeping the area tidy, and comes with the perk of having first dibs on people's junk.

## Furniture Wrangler

We need someone to look after all the furniture that gets ordered, counting it off vehicles when it arrives to check we got what we ordered, arranging distribution around the site, and then checking it all back in at the end of the event. No experience needed, but you will need to be on site a few days before the event starts, and leave a few days after.

## Conduct Team

We're looking for people to join the conduct team, which is responsible for enforcing our [code of conduct](https://emfcamp.org/code-of-conduct). We need people who can respond quickly to issues during the event, with a small amount of work involved in handling issues before and after the event.

As this is a sensitive role, we're looking for people who are trusted among EMF attendees or similar communities.


# Calls for help

Occasionally we'd like to put out a call for help with specific roles. While we'd love to do that with a giant EMF logo beamed into the night sky, we had to settle for a mailing list instead.
