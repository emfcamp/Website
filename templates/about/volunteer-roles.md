# Volunteer Roles

It takes a wide variety of skills to make EMF happen, it's not all network cabling and designing badges. Ahead of the event, a lot of what needs doing is sending emails and project management. If you've got some spare time and would like to help please do [get in touch](mailto:volunteer@emfcamp.org).

In general we're looking for people ahead of the event who are comfortable with some of the following skills:

* Project management
* Supplier management & ordering
* Stage design & production
* Logistics
* Community outreach
* Graphic design
* Web development

We're also looking for people to fill the following specific roles:

## Conduct Team

We're looking for people to join the conduct team, which is responsible for enforcing our [code of conduct](https://emfcamp.org/code-of-conduct). We need people who can respond quickly to issues during the event, with a small amount of work involved in handling issues before and after the event.

As this is a sensitive role, we're looking for people who are trusted among EMF attendees or similar communities.

## Print Designer

The design team are looking for someone with experience using InDesign or similar to help with layout and design of the printed materials that are given to attendees, including the information booklet and badge manual.

## NullSector Production Manager

In the months ahead of the event NullSector need someone to help with administration, supplier management, placing orders, and scheduling. Some knowledge of set construction, staging, and shipping containers would be very helpful.

## Shop Manager

The shop was hugely popular last year, and we're looking for some people to manage it this year. You'll be keeping track of stock, training volunteers on how to work the till, and generally making sure everything runs smoothly.

A driving license and transport would be a huge help in this role to enable going out to restock things, but it isn't essential that everyone involved can drive. We can provide help and support in getting a till system set up.
