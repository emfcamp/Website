<h2 id="volunteering-at-emf">Volunteering at EMF</h2>
<div class="intro-text">
<p>EMF is a non-profit event, entirely organised by volunteers. Nobody is paid to work on EMF, and everyone who attends (with very few exceptions<a href="#footnote">*</a>) pays for their own ticket. This includes the core organisers.</p>
<p>We’d like everyone to consider volunteering to help the event run smoothly, even if it is only for an hour or two.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="getting-involved">Getting Involved</h3>
<p>The EMF organisation is split into teams which organise different aspects of the event. Each team has a lead and a deputy who are responsible for keeping track of work and coordinating with other teams.</p>
<p>To get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the <a href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Teams">teams page</a> on the wiki to find a team you're interested in.</li>
<li>Join the <a href="https://lists.emfcamp.org/listinfo/general">general mailing list</a>, which is the main, low-traffic email list we use for announcing volunteer work.</li>
<li>Get in touch and say you'd like to volunteer, either on <a href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>, or by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@emfcamp.org">contact@emfcamp.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please remember that everyone is a volunteer so you may not get an immediate response. Some teams are a lot more popular than others so may not need your assistance, but many others will be grateful for your help.</p>
<h3 id="teams-seeking-help">Volunteer teams currently seeking help</h3>
<p>These are the volunteer teams that currently need volunteers, each team has a list of vacant roles.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-volunteer">How volunteering works</h3>
<p>We understand that everyone who helps with EMF has other commitments and we plan ahead to cope with this.</p>
<p>We have two golden rules for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t over-commit yourself</li>
<li>Tell us if you can’t get something done</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody will criticise you if you can't do something, and telling us quickly means we can handle the situation.</p>
<h3 id="volunteering-before-the-event">Volunteering before the event</h3>
<p>Running an event like EMF requires a huge amount of planning to make sure the event runs smoothly. This starts a year or more in advance.</p>
<p>A lot of this has already happened for EMF 2018, but we’re keen for more people to help out next time. The best way to get involved for 2020 is to volunteer now so you can shadow the current team during the event.</p>
<h3 id="helping-out-during-the-event">Helping out during the event</h3>
<p>During the event, there are plenty of roles which need to be filled, from construction to cooking for volunteers.</p>
<p>Closer to the event, you’ll be able to log in to the volunteer system which allows you to sign up for shifts. Volunteers who complete a shift will receive a delicious free meal from our volunteer kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="helping-with-setup-teardown">Helping with setup &amp; teardown</h3>
<p>We’re grateful for help setting up the event, and especially tearing it down.</p>
<p>If you want to help with either setup or teardown you will need a ticket to EMF and <u>permission from us to turn up early or stay after the event ends</u>. We do not allow under-18's on site during setup or teardown without explicit permission.</p>
<p>During setup and teardown, EMF is a construction site and we are liable for your safety. If you don’t follow instructions we will be forced to remove you from site, for everyone's safety.</p>
<p>If you’re on site for setup/teardown you have to help with everything - not just what you’re interested in. There’s plenty of lifting and shifting that requiring a degree of physical fitness and mobility. If you’re not actively helping, we will ask you to leave.</p>
<small id="footnote">* We provide free tickets for qualified First Aid staff who must work a minimum of three eight-hour shifts during the event.</small></p>
