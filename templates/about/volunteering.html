<h2 id="volunteering-at-emf">Volunteering at EMF</h2>
<div class="intro-text">
<p>EMF is a non-profit event, entirely organised by volunteers. Nobody is paid to work on EMF, and everyone who attends (with very few exceptions<a href="#footnote">*</a>) pays for their own ticket. This includes the core organisers.</p>
<p>We’d like everyone to consider volunteering to help the event run smoothly, even if it is only for an hour or two.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="getting-involved">Getting Involved</h3>
<p>The EMF organisation is split into teams which organise different aspects of the event. Each team has a lead and a deputy who are responsible for keeping track of work and coordinating with other teams.</p>
<p>To get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the <a href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Teams">teams page</a> on the wiki to find a team you're interested in.</li>
<li>Join the <a href="https://lists.emfcamp.org/listinfo/general">general mailing list</a>, which is the main, low-traffic email list we use for announcing volunteer work.</li>
<li>Get in touch and say you'd like to volunteer, either on <a href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>, or by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@emfcamp.org">contact@emfcamp.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please remember that everyone is a volunteer so you may not get an immediate response. Some teams are a lot more popular than others so may not need your assistance, but many others will be grateful for your help.</p>
<h3 id="teams-seeking-help">Volunteer teams currently seeking help</h3>
<p>These are the volunteer teams that currently need volunteers, each team has a list of vacant roles.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-volunteer">How volunteering works</h3>
<p>We understand that everyone who helps with EMF has other commitments and we plan ahead to cope with this.</p>
<p>We have two golden rules for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t over-commit yourself</li>
<li>Tell us if you can’t get something done</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody will criticise you if you can't do something, and telling us quickly means we can handle the situation.</p>
<h3 id="volunteering-before-the-event">Volunteering before the event</h3>
<p>Running an event like EMF requires a huge amount of planning to make sure the event runs smoothly. This starts a year or more in advance.</p>
<h3 id="helping-out-during-the-event">Helping out during the event</h3>
<p>During the event, there are plenty of roles which need to be filled, from construction to cooking for volunteers.</p>
<p>Closer to the event, you’ll be able to log in to the volunteer system which allows you to sign up for shifts. Volunteers who complete a shift will receive a delicious free meal from our volunteer kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="helping-with-setup-teardown">Helping with setup &amp; teardown</h3>
<p>We’re grateful for help setting up the event, and especially tearing it down.</p>
<p>If you want to help with either setup or teardown you will need a ticket to EMF and <u>permission from us to turn up early or stay after the event ends</u>. We do not allow under-18's on site during setup or teardown without explicit permission.</p>
<p>During setup and teardown, EMF is a construction site and we are liable for your safety. If you don’t follow instructions we will be forced to remove you from site, for everyone's safety.</p>
<p>If you’re on site for setup/teardown you have to help with everything - not just what you’re interested in. There’s plenty of lifting and shifting that requiring a degree of physical fitness and mobility. If you’re not actively helping, we will ask you to leave.</p>
<small id="footnote">* We provide free tickets for qualified First Aid staff who must work a minimum of three eight-hour shifts during the event.</small></p>
