interest of troubleshooting issues with our web sites and dealing with abuse.
These logs will be kept for the shortest time possible, but never later than
12 months after the end of the event.</p>

<h3>Conduct reports</h3>
<p>If we receive a report about your behaviour under our
<a href="{{ url_for('.code_of_conduct') }}">Code of Conduct</a>, we may keep
the report, as well as any other observations, indefinitely. This allows us
to carry out our legitimate interests of keeping the event safe for our
attendees.</p>

<p>Personal information on conduct reports is only made available to members of
the conduct team as well as the Directors of EMF.</p>

<h3>First aid</h3>
<p>If you require first aid at one of our events, your details will be recorded on
