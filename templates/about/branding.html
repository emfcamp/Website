<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This style guide is primarily intended for EMF teams making "official" content for the event.
Due to the nature of EMF, it's difficult to draw a crisp line between official and unofficial, and
we usually don't mind attendees playing with aspects of our style as long as it doesn't mislead
people.</p>

<p>We ask that you <strong>do not sell items with our branding on</strong> without asking us first,
and if you're unsure, please <a href="{{url_for('base.contact')}}">get in touch</a>.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The name of the event is <strong>Electromagnetic Field</strong>, which should always be
written out in full initially, where possible. It can be abbreviated to <strong>EMF</strong> or
<strong>EMF{{ event_year }}</strong> subsequently, as repeating "Electromagnetic Field" a lot can
become cumbersome to read.</p>

<p>The abbreviations <strong>EMF Camp</strong> or <strong>EMFCamp</strong> should never be
used in text when referring to the event. They may be used only in social media usernames and
similar situations, but only where <strong>EMF</strong> is unavailable.</p>

<h2>Written style</h2>
<p>We try to keep a consistent style when communicating to attendees - check out the
<a href="https://blog.emfcamp.org">blog</a> for some examples of this.</p>

<p>Our style is friendly, inclusive, enthusiastic, and clear. We're a community event, not a
faceless corporation, so avoid sounding "corporate" and remember that everyone at EMF is responsible
for making the event happen. Don't use the passive voice and be honest when things go wrong.</p>

<p>We try not to be too serious, but avoid shitposting and in-jokes on our main communication
channels - it's alienating to people who might be new to our community. Team accounts on social
media have more leeway here.</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>Our primary typeface is <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway">Raleway</a>
which is available under an open license. Specifically we use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Raleway Regular (400 weight) for printed body content and the logo text.</li>
    <li>Raleway Semi-Bold (600 weight) for headings and the year in the logo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid using other weights unless it's necessary for clarity or to distinguish between different
    levels of headings.</p>

<h3>Sizes</h3>
<p>Unless really necessary, use font size 12pt as a minimum for documents that are printed to be
held and read, such as booklets, pamphlets, cards, and so on. Make sure you think about the viewing
distance for other objects. If in doubt, go large and clear.</p>
