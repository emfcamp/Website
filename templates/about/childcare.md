# Childcare
We'll be providing free childcare for 0-12 year olds run by professionals. There's no need to register in advance. At busy times there might be a limit on how long your children can stay for to allow as many people as possible to drop off their children too.

## Operating Hours
**Thursday:** 2pm to 6pm
**Friday:** 10:30am to 6pm
**Saturday:** 10:30am to 6pm
**Sunday:** 10:30am to 2pm

## Youth Workshops
We will also have a schedule of workshops targeted at under 12's which will be announced closer to the event.

Not all of the content in the main schedule will be suitable for children or younger teenagers, but they are welcome to attend at your discretion.
