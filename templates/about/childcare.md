# Childcare
We'll be providing free childcare for 0-16 year olds, provided by the award-winning [Nipperbout](https://www.nipperbout.com). There's no need to register in advance. At busy times there might be a limit on how long your children can stay for to allow as many people as possible to drop off their children too.

## Operating Hours
**Thursday:** 2pm to 8pm
**Friday to Sunday:** 10:30am to 8pm

All staff caring for children are professionals who have been DBS checked.

## Youth Workshops
We will also have a schedule of workshops targeted at a range of ages. Please check back later closer to the event for more details.

Not all of the content in the main schedule will be suitable for children or younger teenagers, but they are welcome to attend at your discretion.
