# Live-in Vehicles

Camper vans, caravans, trailer tents, and car tents are allowed at EMF in the designated live-in vehicle areas. You must have a live-in vehicle ticket to bring one of these vehicles to EMF - you cannot stay in the main car park area.

If your vehicle is an integral part of a village or installation please contact us in advance for permission to park it outside the live-in vehicle areas.

The maximum size of a live-in vehicle pitch is 8m Ã— 6m. You can bring an awning or a small additional tent, but please don't use too much space, as we want to fit as many vehicles in as possible.

If you are bringing a caravan or a trailer tent, the towing vehicle must be parked in the main car park, but it does not require a separate parking ticket.

## Facilities

The site at Eastnor is quite hilly and we can't guarantee a level pitch - please bring levelling ramps. We will provide power as a 16A ceeform connector (see [our power page](/about/power)). Water will be available from taps around the site but you will have to carry it.

There are two toilet waste disposal points, near the [north toilets](https://map.emfcamp.org/#17/52.0424574/-2.3770253/m=52.0425712,-2.3769645) and the [south toilets](https://map.emfcamp.org/#17/52.040493/-2.377293/m=52.0408227,-2.3787174).

## Arrival and departure

You should aim to arrive between **08:00 and 16:00 on Thursday** or between **08:00 and 12:00 on Friday**, and depart on **Monday between 12:00 and 16:00**. Arrivals and departures outside these hours may be possible, but they will be slower due to the need to escort vehicles to keep attendees safe.

No live-in vehicle movements are allowed after dark. If you arrive after sunset, you can stay in the car park until morning.

## Vehicle deliveries

If you are getting a live-in vehicle delivered or collected by a third party who does not have a ticket to EMF, it must be delivered on **Wednesday between 11:00 and 18:00** and collected between **Monday 12:00 and Tuesday 12:00**.

Please email us at [tickets@emfcamp.org](mailto:tickets@emfcamp.org) beforehand to let us know the details of the vehicle (including registration number if known) and who will be delivering and collecting it.
