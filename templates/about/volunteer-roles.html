<h2 id="volunteer-roles">Pre-event Volunteer Roles</h2>
<div class="intro-text">
  <p>We're looking for people to fill the roles listed below, please keep in mind that all of them require a time
    commitment ahead of the event.</p>
  <p>Some of these are entirely new roles for 2022, while others are making sure we have dedicated people focused on
    specific roles, rather than people taking on multiple roles.</p>
  <p>If any of these roles are of interest to you please send an email to <a
      href="mailto:volunteers@emfcamp.org">volunteers@emfcamp.org</a> and introduce yourself.</p>
  <p>If you can't find a role that interests you but would still like to help, get in touch - we'll do our best to find
    something that interests you!</p>
</div>

<div id="content" class="well content-well">
  <h3>Content Team</h3>

  <h4>Content Team Leads</h4>
  <p>Ahead of the event the content team leads are responsible for making sure there's something to do once you arrive
    at EMF, organising the talks, workshops, performances and installations around the site. They are responsible for
    managing the content sub-teams and ensuring that all teams operate smoothly both in the run-up and during the event.
  </p>
  <p>In the run up to the event you should be able to commit to about 20 hours a month, particularly around the CfP
    opening and closing.</p>

  <h4>Outreach &amp; Communications</h4>
  <p>The outreach team researches and gets in touch with people we’d like to speak, bring art, or run workshops. They
    manage the process of finding &amp; inviting them, working out any needs they have, and handing over to the
    logistics team to make sure everything is in place.</p>

  <h4>Workshops Co-ordinator</h4>
  <p>The workshops coordinators organise where workshops take place, all required equipment, and that it's available in
    the right place at the right time. This role requires communicating with villages that host workshops.</p>

  <h4>Green Room</h4>
  <p>Before the event the green room team communicate with selected and potential speakers, answering questions and
    helping them write excellent Call for Participation submissions.</p>
  <p>On site the green room team make sure speakers are on the right stage at the right time, have the equipment they
    need, and that heralds introduce them correctly.</p>
  <p>All communication with speakers, workshops and performers is handled by the Green Room team on-site, and they often
    assist speakers with polishing their talks in the run-up to the event.</p>

  <h4>Music Team Lead / Deputy</h4>
  <p>Responsible for booking and organising all music at the event, along with artist relations. Artists are sourced
    both from our Call for Participation, and by direct outreach. This position will be supported by the rest of the
    Music Team.</p>
  <p>This role will need to commit about 10 hours a month ahead of the event to find, contact, and book artists, as well
    as working with your team.</p>

  <h4>Music Team</h4>
  <p>The music team arrange artists to play on the main stages each evening, and DJs for the Cybar dance floor. This
    year we may also have additional performance spaces.</p>
  <p>During the event the music team manage the stages each night, ensuring bands &amp; equipment are transported to
    stages, bands are looked after, and stage times are adhered to.</p>
  <p>While we have sound and lighting technicians available in our stage team, any experience in this area is helpful.
  </p>

<div id="arts" class="well content-well">
  <h3>Arts Team</h3>
  <p>Responsible for curating installations &amp; artwork across the site, both those submitted to the Call for
    Participation and outreach to things we'd love to exhibit on site. Responsible for grant applications to funding
    organisations such as the Arts Council, and communication with people who wish to exhibit.</p>

  <h4>Arts Logistics &amp; Ops</h4>
  <p>Logistics make sure we can get artworks &amp; installations to the site, and ensure they’ll be covered by our
    insurance ahead of the event. Once on site they’ll be welcoming invited artists to the site, locating &amp;
    installing artworks, and making sure they have power, network, and anything else they need.</p>

  <h4>Arts Installation Support Service</h4>
  <p>This team exists to help people who want to bring installations to EMF, starting with helping them to understand
    whether they need support at all. If they do, the team will help them find a place for their installation to live,
    and coordinate with logistics to make sure they get power, network, or required insurance coverage.</p>
  <p>They also put people in touch with each other who might want to collaborate on installations, and manage the Shiny
    Fund, a pot of money to provide small grants for installations that need it.</p>

  <h4>Special Projects</h4>
  <p>We’re looking for two or three project managers/arts production people to manage specific projects. Some experience
    of managing arts projects, events, or similar would be helpful (or an enthusiasm to learn, there’ll be support from
    the rest of the team).</p>
</div>
<!-- </arts> -->

<div id="volunteer" class="well content-well">
  <h3>Volunteer Team</h3>
  <h4>Catering Manager</h4>
  <p>The catering manager will work with the chefs to make sure all the required equipment has been hired or bought
    ahead of time, organise food deliveries, and manage the kitchen team rota during the event.</p>
</div>

<div id="design" class="well content-well">
  <h3>Design Team</h3>
  <p>In addition to the flags and beermats that may be familiar from the last EMF, for 2022 the new Design team will
    coordinate with other volunteers across EMF to help ensure the festival looks as cohesive and beautiful as possible,
    from the website to the wristbands to backgrounds for the stages.</p>

    <p>We’ve spelled out a few specific jobs we’d like to recruit for, but if you’d like to get involved in another
    capacity please get in touch, we’d love to hear from you!</p>

    <p>Whatever role you might like to take we’ll do our best to inform and support you, so come and have fun making EMF
    beautiful! </p>


  <h4>Logistics</h4>
  <p>In order to deliver the event, we need to wrangle a lot of suppliers, materials, equipment, volunteers, fabrication
    and transport. If you’re up for some admin, spreadsheets and emails, please jump in!</p>

  <h4>Lounge Lead</h4>
  <p>The lounge is a social space for attendees to relax, catch up with friends or take some time away from the bustle
    of the festival. We’re looking for a volunteer to oversee the design of this space, and work with other EMF teams to
    organise furniture, lighting, layout and any appropriate installations, as well as plan setup before the event.</p>

  <h4>Booklet Co-ordinator</h4>
  <p>The EMF Booklet is one of the first things attendees receive when they arrive on site, so it’s very important that
    it is accessible and clear! We’re looking for someone with an eye for words, layouts and who is comfortable working
    with contributors. You’ll liaise with other EMF teams to compile all the relevant information, and be assisted by
    our graphic designer and our mapmaker. It is probable you’ll also work on a matching Badge Booklet.</p>

  <h4>Merch Co-ordinator</h4>
  <p>Stickers, postcards and T-shirts, oh my! This role is all about the details and logistics, and researching the best
    options to ensure quality and price. Ideally you’d be comfortable with preparing or adjusting graphics to suit each
    type of merch, but other members of the team can help out if it’s not your strong suit.</p>

  <h4>Graphics</h4>
  <p>If you can sling some pixels or splines around, your help would be greatly appreciated in adapting our graphic
    assets to wherever they’re needed, such as merchandise, site dressings, video idents and printed materials.</p>

  <h4>Inflatable Tentacle Fabricators</h4>
  <p>A sea-themed festival obviously needs some tentacles! Our prototyper has got us most of the way there with some
    huge illuminated, animated, inflatable monstrosities, but we need volunteers to take over and take them to the
    finish line. We’d like you to start from the plans for the prototype, finalise the design, work with our Lighting
    team on the electronics and controls, and coordinate or carry out production of the final products. </p>

  <p>This job would be ideal for two or three makers who live close together and are used to collaborating together.

      Recruitment Brief</a></p>

  <h4>General Sewists</h4>
  <p>This year we’re using printed fabric as our main material and will need help to stitch our plans together. If you
    have a sewing machine and are happy to sew a few metres of bunting, flags and signage in advance of the festival
    please get in touch.</p>

  <p>Individuals or groups welcome, we’ll ship materials to you and arrange collection or delivery of completed items.
  </p>

  <h4>General Fabricators</h4>
  <p>We will want to build some odd items, so if you’re a hands-on fabricator able to get stuck in and solve problems in
    functional and cost-effective ways please say Hi. The exact list of fabrication jobs are to be confirmed, but if you
    give us an idea of your location, what skills and facilities are at your disposal and what your availability is
    like, we’ll contact you if a suitable task comes up. </p>

  <h4>Setup crew</h4>
  <p>It’s a little early to recruit for this, but if you are able to arrive to site a day early, there may be specialist
    decor assembly and deployment jobs that need a dedicated person. We should only need a few folks here, to be
    confirmed in early May.</p>
  <p>NB: DO NOT SHOW UP EARLY UNLESS CLEARED BY A TEAM LEAD</p>
