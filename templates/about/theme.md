# Our theme for 2026 is SPACE.

We love to see your contributions about whatever gets you nerdy and excited, but if you’d like to build on the theme of the event and add to its impact we are sharing our plan with you here. We hope you will be inspired to join in!

It’s a very big universe out there. Gazing up at the night sky it can be hard to tell a satellite from a star from a galaxy, but further study is rewarded with a deeper understanding.

Find something that facinates you, from the whorls on your fingertips to the spiral arms of a galaxy. Take that second look, and a third, and a fourth. Show us what you see, and help others explore this realm of beauty and complexity we share.

We may be standing on a pale blue dot, but there’s definitely a lot going on down here.

We will be drawing design inspiration from

- stellar and space imagery
- space exploration and engineering
- planetary and geological sciences
- atmospheric sciences
- molecules, microspcopy and imaging systems
- speculative and real-world biology
- sci-fi fiction and media

We hope you have fun scheming your talks, workshops, projects and artworks and look forward to hearing about them when the Call for Participation opens.
