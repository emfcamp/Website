# Traders
EMF is a non-profit community festival. With the exception of food traders we do not
allow any other professional traders on site.

## Food traders
If you're interested in applying to be a food trader at EMF, please drop an email to
[vendors@emfcamp.org](mailto:vendors@emfcamp.org). Please provide a photo of your stall, a sample
menu, and a list of recent events you have traded at.

## Other traders
We regret that we are not interested in any non-food traders at EMF.

## Attendees
If you're an EMF attendee, you are welcome to sell items you've made at EMF, but please: no big
adverts and no full-time stalls. You can also apply to sell your items at the Night Market - keep
an eye on your email for details on how to apply.
