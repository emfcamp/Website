title: Diversity Stats 2024
---

Here 'speaker' refers to anyone who has a proposal accepted (talk, workshop, youth workshop, performance or installation) through the official EMF CfP. It does not account for attendee content or lightning talks. 'Response rate' is the percentage of speakers who responded to that question.

A 'reviewer' is a member of our call for participation review panel, they review our anonymised proposals.

Invited Speakers only covers those who agreed to give a workshop or talk. We reached out to over 190 people about potentially giving a talk, but we didn't collect data on all of them.

These statistics are correct as of 2024-05-14, so the final published numbers may change slightly due to last-minute alterations in the schedule.

#### By type

Note that the totals here will differ from those for speakers, because some speakers have multiple submissions (e.g. a workshop and a talk).
