# What to Bring

## Vital Stuff
* Tent (or space in someone else's)
* Bedding - a sleeping bag and a pillow. It can get cold at night, so consider bringing an extra blanket
* Clean clothes
* A towel, shower gel, shampoo, soap, toothbrush, etc. (We have showers!)
* Torch and extra batteries. The site will be well-lit, but there will be darker bits (e.g. inside your tent)
* Food and/or money for food. All on-site bars and vendors accept cards.
* Walking boots and/or wellies (the site is a field, good shoes are a must)
* Waterproofs. This is the UK: it will probably rain
* Warm clothing for evenings and sleeping in if it gets cold
* Medicines, hayfever tablets (again, the site is a field)
* Hand sanitiser
* Masks and lateral flow tests (see [our health advice](/about/health))
* Sun cream and/or a sun hat
* Your EMF ticket (printed or saved on your phone - these will be issued shortly before the event)

## Useful Things
* A 20-30m power lead, ideally with a 16A plug - [more info on power](/about/power)
* Pint or half-pint cups to use at the bar for a small discount (This must be [UKCA, CE or Crown marking](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/applying-a-crown-symbol-to-pint-glasses))
* A long (as long as the power lead) ethernet cable to connect your tent
* A computer
* A DECT phone to make and receive phone calls via the local DECT network
* Europe to UK plug adaptors (if you have non-UK equipment)
* Making gear (for any/all of your hobbies)
* A water bottle and/or mug, useful for food & drink (when not got from vendors)
* Tape, gaffer, LX, whatever, always helpful for fixing things that break (like tents)
* Pen and paper
* Bin bags (for rubbish and dirty clothes)
* A few gold and silver space blankets and clothes pins to cover your tent and prevent it from turning into an oven in the morning sun
* Cash, some workshops will have a small fee to cover materials, this will need to be paid in cash to the organiser (there are ATMs in Ledbury if you need to get cash).

## Advice for Villages/Large Groups
* A small camping kettle may come in handy (larger kettles require care). We have food and drink vendors on site.
* A camping stove shouldn't be needed but will be permitted as long as it's off the ground. Remember not to store BBQs or similar stoves inside a tent, due to the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.
* A network switch may reduce the amount of network cabling required, but please let the NOC know if you need to connect more than 10 devices. Wireless access points are not allowed at all.
* The switches in the DKs won't work at 10Mbps, so if you need 10baseT connectivity (e.g. for old or embedded things) please bring a switch.
* A mini-fridge may be useful for storing milk.

## Things Not to Bring
* Glass bottles: broken glass is a pain to clean up.
* Pets: The site does not allow dogs or, indeed, any other animals.
