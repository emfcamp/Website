# Travelling to Electromagnetic Field

EMF will be held at the Eastnor Castle Deer Park, just east of Ledbury, Herefordshire.

You can arrive after 10am on Thursday 30 May and you can stay until midday on Monday 3 June{# 2024 #}. You won't be allowed on site outside those times unless you've [volunteered](/volunteering) to help with setup or teardown.

## By Train
EMF is close to Ledbury station which is around [three hours](https://traintimes.org.uk/london+paddington/ledbury/) from London Paddington (on [GWR](https://www.gwr.com)) and [one hour](https://traintimes.org.uk/birmingham+new+street/ledbury) from Birmingham New Street (on [West Midlands Railway](https://www.westmidlandsrailway.co.uk/)).

The station at Ledbury has short platforms, so if you are on one of the long 9-coach trains direct from Paddington, you will need to be in the front three coaches to get off the train.

We will be providing a free shuttle bus service between Ledbury station and the EMF site approximately every half hour. The bus will leave from the bus stop on the road just outside the station.

## By Car
If you plan to drive, you will need to [buy a parking ticket or live-in vehicle ticket](/tickets/other). Motorcycles do not require a parking ticket. 

Plan your travel to the south gate on the A438 - postcode **HR8 1RQ** should get you there. The entrance to the site is located at [52.0322, -2.3837](geo:52.03222,-2.3837), grid reference SO 73774 37158.

Once you're near the site, you'll see yellow temporary road signs for EMFÂ - follow these and ignore your sat nav if it tells you differently.

Unless you are travelling in a live-in vehicle, you will be parked in the main car park which is adjacent to the event site, at most a 300m walk from the main gate. [More information for live-in vehicles](/about/live-in-vehicles).

 <!-- We encourage attendees to carpool where possible. There's a [lift sharing](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Location/Lift_sharing) page on the wiki to find other people on the same route. -->

### Electric Vehicles
We do not provide electric vehicle charging at EMF. We ask that you arrive at the event with enough charge to leave at the end of the event. We will be able to provide EV charging in an emergency.

## By Bike

While we do not have any dedicated bike parking, EMF is an extremely safe event and you are welcome to lock your bike to our perimeter fence or other structures as long as it's out of the way.

## By Air
The closest major airport is [Birmingham (BHX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Airport), which is around 1:40 by train to Ledbury station; or an hour by road. [Bristol (BRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Airport) and [Cardiff (CWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Airport) are around 1:40 by road, but poorly connected by public transport.

For those travelling long-haul, BHX is likely to be most useful followed by LHR.
