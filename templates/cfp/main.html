<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
    <div class="well">
      <p>The Call for Participation will close for talks & workshops on
        <span class="emphasis">Thursday 25th April</span>.</p>
      <p>You will still be able to submit installations, performances and youth
        workshops after this date</p>
    </div>

    <p class="emphasis"><a href="{{ url_for('base.about') }}">Electromagnetic
      Field</a> is a camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind
      or an interest in making things. It will be held from {{ fancy_dates }} at <a
      href="{{ url_for('base.page', page_name='travel') }}">Eastnor
      Castle Deer Park</a> in Herefordshire, UK.</p>

    <p>We're looking for talks, performances, and workshops for
      all ages.  We're especially keen to hear from people with
      different backgrounds than you'd expect to find at a technology conference.</p>

    <p>At previous events we've heard about everything from genetic modification
      to electronics, blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering
      to lock picking, computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to brewing.
      If you're enthusiastic about it, we are too! You don't need to consider yourself a
      professional or an expert to present.</p>

    <p>If you submit a talk or workshop proposal, it will be <a href="{{ url_for('.guidance') }}" target="_blank">reviewed anonymously</a> by a
      diverse selection panel.</p>

    <h3>Money</h3>
    <p>EMF is a non-profit community event, entirely run by unpaid volunteers. All of
      the ticket cost goes directly towards turning a field into an amazing place
      to spend a weekend, and all those who attend contribute to making the event a success.</p>

    <p>As with all contributors to EMF, speakers do not receive any payment, although
       we have some budget to subsidise travel within the UK for those who could not
       otherwise afford it. We also have some funds available for up-front costs for
       workshops, for example, to develop kits for attendees.</p>

    <h3>Tickets</h3>
    <p>You will be guaranteed the opportunity to buy tickets if your talk,
      workshop, youth workshop, or performance proposal is accepted. There are a
      limited number of tickets available for exceptional installations. The guarantee is
      for <strong>two</strong> adult tickets: one for you at a 33% discount, and one for a
      friend or partner at full price. You are also guaranteed as many child tickets as you
      need.</p>
    
    <p>If you only wish to attend for the day of your talk/workshop/performance, we
      can offer you a free day ticket, but we encourage you to stick around for the whole event!</p>

    <h2>Submit a new proposal</h2>
    <p>Please select the type of proposal you want to submit:</p>
