<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
    <p class="emphasis"><a href="{{ url_for('base.about') }}">Electromagnetic
        Field</a> is a UK camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind
        or an interest in making things. It will be held from {{ fancy_dates }} at <a
        href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Location">Eastnor
        Castle Deer Park</a>, Ledbury.</p>

    <p>We're looking for talks, performances, and workshops for
    all ages.  We're especially keen to hear from people with
      different backgrounds than you'd expect to find at a technology conference.</p>

    <p>At previous events we've heard about everything from genetic modification
      to electronics, blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering
      to lock picking, computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to brewing.
      If you're enthusiastic about it, we are too! You don't need to consider yourself a
      professional or an expert to present.</p>

    <h3>Money</h3>
    <p>EMF is a non-profit community event, entirely run by unpaid volunteers. All of
      the ticket cost goes directly towards turning a field into an amazing place
      to spend a weekend, and all those who attend contribute to making the event a success.</p>

    <p>As with all contributors to EMF, speakers do not receive any payment, although we have
        some budget to subsidise travel within the UK for those who could not otherwise afford
        it.</p>

    <h3>Tickets</h3>
    <p>You will be guaranteed the opportunity to buy EMF tickets if your talk,
    workshop, youth workshop, or performance proposal is accepted. There are a
    limited number of tickets available for exceptional installations.</p>

    <p>The guarantee is for <strong>two</strong> adult tickets: one for you at
    a 33% discount, and one for a friend or partner at full price. You are also
    guaranteed as many child tickets as you need.
    
    <p>If you only wish to attend for the day of your talk/workshop/performance we can offer you a free day ticket.</strong></p>

    <h3>Selection</h3>
    <p>
        After you submit a proposal, it will be considered by a diverse
        selection panel across multiple review rounds. For more on the EMF
        selection process, see our <a href="{{ url_for('.guidance') }}" target="_blank">guidance</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('.guidance')}}#timeline">timeline</a>.
    </p>

    <p>We also have guidance available for <a href="{{ url_for('.installation_support') }}" target="_blank">those who wish to display installations</a> at EMF.</p>
