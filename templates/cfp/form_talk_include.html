<h3>What we're looking for</h3>
<p>At previous events we've heard about everything from genetic modification to
electronics history, antarctic research to eco-houses, blacksmithing to
high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking, computer security to
crocheting, and quadcopters to brewing.</p>

<p>If you're enthusiastic about it, we are too! You don't need to be a professional or an expert to present:
<strong>impostors are welcome</strong>.</p>

<h3>What it's like</h3>
<p>We'll give you one of our three stages for up to an hour to talk on any subject. The smallest stage seats 500, the largest 1000. If this sounds scary don't worry &ndash; our audience is very friendly, and our Speaker Operations team will help you prepare both before the event and on the day. If you've never given a talk before we're happy to advise and help you with your presentation.</p>
<p>If your talk is under 10 minutes we might ask you to give a Lightning Talk instead, where one hour-long slot is filled by many people all giving short talks (often for the first time).</p>

<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>After you submit a proposal, it will be considered anonymously by a diverse
selection panel. For more on the EMF selection process, see our
