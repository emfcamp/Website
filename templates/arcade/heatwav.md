HEAT.wav is a turn-based tactical game; you play a heat demon trying to expand your domain, all under the watchful eyes of your diabolical supervisor, Beelzebud. In eight short levels, HEAT.wav playfully explores the intersection of capitalism and heat emergencies through humorous dialogue, with game mechanics inspired by real-world environmental hazards and symptoms. It was created for the March 2024 IGDA Climate SIG Microjam by Aric McBay, a gamedev and climate justice organizer.
