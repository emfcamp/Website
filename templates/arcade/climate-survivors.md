In Climate Survivors, you’re tackling the climate crisis head on and guns blazing. Fight hordes of environmental hazards empowered by global heating, dodge their merciless attacks and … survive! Climate Survivors is a top-down shoot 'em up infused by climate science, where players travel to different locations in the world and face climate hazards most pressing there — droughts, floods, invasive species and many more. They fight back using weapons and upgrades based on low-carbon options available to society already today. Their strategic choices affect how dangerous hazards and how hard — or easy — the fight against them will become… and what life on Earth might look like in 2100. Climate Survivors is currently a constantly evolving prototype. In its current version, the game is focused on the core action, where players dodge and fight against looming climate hazards in Austria. The next versions will see the implementation of a wider range of weapons and hazard monsters, as well as a more elaborate upgrade system.
