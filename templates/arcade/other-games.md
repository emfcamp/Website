# Games in Other Places
There are several other games around the festival site - try to find them all!

* In the bar we have Appy Bird by Iain Sharp, Climax by Tim Hunkin, NERF Shooting Range by Brian Corteil, Cyber Coin Pusher by Elger Jonker and the ZAPP tabletop game by Alison,
* In the youth lounge we have a solar-powered arcade cabinet made by Leigh Hackspace running a selection of PICO-8 games by Johan Peitz,
* Flock by Ricky Haggett can be found in a dome,
* We have a Monumental GameBoy by Jonathan Leach,
* Anthony Goacher will be running regular games of Lasertag,
* Also, keep an eye out around the site for the various games that make up the Clippy Puzzlehunt!

Some games were offered for the arcade but couldn't make it in for various reasons, but you can play them from the comfort of your own phone/desktop PC!

These are:
* [Reforest Rainforest by Andreas Wildgrube](https://www.gamesfortheplanet.com/#26d7debe-785f-46d9-ba70-2f9879af2a12), where the monetisation funds reforestation efforts.
