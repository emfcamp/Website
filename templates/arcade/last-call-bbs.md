Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!

The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!

Games available:

* **20th Century Food Court**: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your machines running fast!
* **STEED FORCE Hobby Studio**: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!
* **X’BPGH**: The Forbidden Path: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life… but can you trust the master?
* **Sawayama Solitaire**: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on the classic Klondike.
* **Dungeons & Diagrams**: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?
* **ChipWizard™ Professional**: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?
