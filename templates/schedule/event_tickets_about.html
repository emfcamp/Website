<h2>Workshop sign-up</h2>

<p>Workshops at EMF are always extremely oversubscribed. To make (youth)workshops
  more equitable as well as preventing long queues, we're introducing an online
  sign up system for most workshops.</p>

<p>The majority of workshop places will be allocated via a lottery, which you can
  enter and win tickets for one workshop in advance. For most workshops, any
  remaining or returned tickets will be made available online on a first-come,
  first-served basis before the workshop is due to take place. Remaining places
  for youth workshops will be allocated at the Youth Workshop tent on a first-come,
  first-served basis 15 minutes before the workshop start time.</p>

<p>To enter the workshop lottery:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="{{ url_for('.main') }}">schedule</a> and choose the
    workshops you'd most like to attend. Any that are part of the lottery are
    marked with ðŸŽŸ</li>
  <li>Click on each workshop title and select how many tickets you would like.
    You can choose a maximum of 2 places for workshops, or a maximum of 5
    children's places for youth workshops.</li>
  <li>After you've selected all the workshops you would like to enter the lottery
    for, go to <a href="{{ url_for('.event_tickets') }}">the workshop tickets page</a>
    and arrange them in your order of preference.</li>
</ol>

<p>All under-16s attending workshops must be accompanied by an adult. For youth
  workshops, adults accompanying under-16s do not need their own ticket for the workshop.
  For workshops running outside the youth workshop tent, adults accompanying children
  will need their own ticket as well.</p>

<p>On Wednesday 29th May lottery places will be allocated. The lottery will be
  closed from this point onwards.</p>

<p>You can only win places for one workshop. You will get sent a code for this,
  which you will be asked for by the workshop stewards to gain entrance to your
  allocated workshop, or you can provide your name. You can share your code(s)
  with others, but only one person will be admitted per code.</p>

<p>Any other workshop lotteries you entered will appear as 'cancelled' on the
  workshop tickets page.</p>

<p>You can still sign up for tickets for other workshops. These tickets will be
  available once the event starts on a first-come first-served basis but there
  won't be as many.</p>

<p>Workshops provided by Villages will not be using this system, and how you can
  attend these workshops will be decided by each individual village. The best
  idea is to visit the village early and ask them.</p>
