<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p class="summary"><a href="http://www.emfcamp.org/">Electromagnetic Field</a> is a three-day camping festival for people with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, geeks, scientists, engineers, artists, and craftspeople. A great gathering of specialists, enthusiasts and newcomers from many disciplines, with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects, and many opportunities to collaborate or have a drink with someone new.</p>

<h2>Where is it?</h2>

<p><a href="http://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Location">Pineham Park, Milton Keynes, MK15 9LZ, UK</a></p>

<p>Milton Keynes has great transport links to the rest of the UK and Europe. It's only 40 minutes on the train from London, and the site lies close to the M1 motorway.</p>

<h2>When is it?</h2>

<p>Friday 31st August - Monday 3rd September 2012</p>

<p>Events and activities will run throughout the day and into the evening, everything else (chats, debates, impromptu circus performances) will run as long as your collective energy lasts.</p>

<h2>How much will it cost?</h2>

<p>Between £80 and £100. We're still ironing out some details, so the ticket price hasn't quite been finalised.</p>

<p>Your ticket gives you a place to pitch your tent with power and internet, access to all events, the bar, and the camp's social areas. (Some workshops may charge money to cover material cost.)</p>

<p>We're already allowing people to <a href="http://www.emfcamp.org/">put down a £30 deposit</a> for their ticket, and we encourage everyone to make use of this. This deposit will entitle you to a £5 rebate off the final ticket price, and it helps us cover deposits, insurance, and other up-front costs. It is also one of the indicators we use to anticipate your level of interest; we will make infrastructure and budgeting choices based on the pre-sales response. So if you intend to come <a href="http://www.emfcamp.org/">please buy one</a>!</p>

<h2>What can I expect there?</h2>

<p>We're currently working hard to ensure the campsite will have everything you'll need (food, a cash bar, internet, showers and toilets) as well as all the things that you'll expect from a festival: larger tents for talks and workshops, general hacking areas, and plenty of space to create your own hangout spots. </p>

<p>In terms of actual happenings we want to accommodate three key aspects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We encourage everyone to <strong>camp together and form <a href="http://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages">villages</a></strong> around shared interests and shared facilities. Everyone is welcome to join, or to start their own village.</li>
	<li>There will be <strong>scheduled activities like talks, workshops,</strong> performances, panels, discussions, ... but also many opportunities to improvise. Think <strong>unconference-style sessions</strong> at a camp.</li>
	<li>There will be many informal opportunities to <strong>meet new people</strong> for cooking sessions, to play games, to collaborate on great hacks, and just generally hang out.</li>
</ul>
