# <Installation>

In the `<Installation>` tent you can find Jem Finer's [Supercomputer](/schedule/2024/631). This is a special EMF 2024 challenge. We have been given the raw parts of this extraordinary mechanical computer and a weekend to try and rebuild it.

You can keep a piece of the artwork at the end of the festival with a donation to the [Longplayer Trust](https://longplayer.org). Look in the tent for more details.
