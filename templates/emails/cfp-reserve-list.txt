Hi {{ proposal.user.name }},

Your EMF {{ proposal.human_type }} proposal '{{ proposal.title }}' is currently on the reserve list and may be accepted closer than one month to the event - this is because we have last-minute drop-outs. Your proposal was very highly rated, but didn't quite make the main selection.

Regardless of whether your proposal is selected, we'd like to offer you the opportunity to get EMF tickets for you and a friend.

You can buy those tickets here: {{ reserve_ticket_link }}

The tickets will be available until Wednesday 15th August.

If you'd like to cancel your proposal as it is too close to the event, or you can no longer attend, please let us know.

Thanks,
The EMF Team
