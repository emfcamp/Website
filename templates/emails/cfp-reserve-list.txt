Hi {{ proposal.user.name }},

Your EMF {{ proposal.human_type }} proposal '{{ proposal.title }}' is currently on the reserve list and may be accepted at short notice if we have last minute drop-outs. Your proposal was highly rated, but didn't quite make the main selection.

If you'd like to cancel your proposal as it is too close to the event, or you can no longer attend, please withdraw your proposal on our website: https://www.emfcamp.org/cfp/proposals

We will shortly be opening lightning talk signups, so if you would like to give a very short talk instead please keep an eye out.

Thanks,
The EMF Team
