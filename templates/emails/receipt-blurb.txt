You don't need to print out your admission tickets - we can check
them on your phone - but if you have a parking ticket you'll need
to print it out and leave it on your dashboard.

Now is a good time to share any tickets you bought for friends. You
can either forward this email to them, or log back in and download
any combination of e-tickets:

If you're coming by car and you don't have a parking ticket, you'll
need to buy one before you arrive:

If you're travelling by public transport, we will be running shuttle
buses between a local train station and the festival site.

For more details about how to get to EMF, including shuttle bus times
and driving directions, please see the Travel section of our wiki:

And lastly, EMF is entirely volunteer-run. Please consider
contributing a few hours of your time at the festival to help the
event run smoothly.
