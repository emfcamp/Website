Hello {{ user.name }}!

With Electromagnetic Field fast approaching, here are your tickets

Thursday 30th May {#- 2024 #} to allow you to set up and get comfortable, and our
programme of content kicks off at 11am on Friday.

Unless you're helping out with teardown, you should aim to leave by
midday on Monday 3rd June {#- 2024 #}.
