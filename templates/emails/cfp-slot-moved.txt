Hi {{ proposal.user.name }},

Unfortunately we have had to move your EMF {{ proposal.human_type }} '{{ proposal.title }}'. We've done our best to minimise the amount of hassle it will cause you.

You have a {{ proposal.scheduled_duration }} minute slot in {{ proposal.scheduled_venue.name }} on {{ proposal.scheduled_time.strftime('%A at %-I:%M %p') }}. If this is not suitable, please let us know as soon as possible.

If you'd like to share this with people, the public link to your {{ proposal.human_type }} is: https://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/{{ proposal.id }}

Things to note:

* If you have special requirements and have not spoken to our speaker ops team about them, please reply to this email.

* Please report to the Green Room 30 minutes before your {{ proposal.human_type }} so that the speaker ops team can make sure everything is ready for you, and your {{ proposal.human_type }} will go as smoothly as possible!

* It is possible that we may have to reschedule your {{ proposal.human_type }} before the event starts, so please make sure you've updated your availability:

  {{ external_url('cfp.finalise_proposal', proposal_id=proposal.id) }}

* You can also update your {{ proposal.human_type }} title and description at any time using the link above, so make sure it sounds great!

{% if proposal.type == 'talk' %}
* While you are allowed on-stage Q&A within your slot, we would prefer it if you asked the audience to meet you somewhere afterwards to discuss it.
{% endif %}

* All this information and more is available on our speakers website page: https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Speaking

Looking forward to seeing you in the field,
The EMF Speaker Ops Team
