Hi {{ proposal.user.name }},

Your EMF {{ proposal.human_type }} '{{ proposal.title }}' has been scheduled!

You have a {{ proposal.scheduled_duration }} minute slot in {{ proposal.scheduled_venue.name }} on {{ proposal.scheduled_time.strftime('%A at %-I:%M %p') }}. If this is not suitable, please let us know as soon as possible.

If you'd like to share this with people, the public link to your {{ proposal.human_type }} is: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/{{ event_year }}/{{ proposal.id }}

Things to note:

* If you have special requirements and have not spoken to our speaker ops team about them, please reply to this email.

{% if proposal.type == 'talk' %}
* Please report to the Green Room 30 minutes before your {{ proposal.human_type }} so that the speaker ops team can make sure everything is ready for you, and your {{ proposal.human_type }} will go as smoothly as possible!
{% endif %}
{% if proposal.type == 'workshop' %}
* Please head to the workshop venue 30 minutes before your session is due to start, so you can set everything up, and the team there can sort out the furniture and AV kit as needed for your workshop.
{% endif %}

* It is possible that we may have to reschedule your {{ proposal.human_type }} before the event starts, so please make sure you've updated your availability:

  {{ external_url('cfp.finalise_proposal', proposal_id=proposal.id) }}

* You can also update your {{ proposal.human_type }} title and description at any time using the link above, so make sure it sounds great!

{% if proposal.type == 'talk' %}
* We would strongly prefer that you do not take on-stage Q&A after your talk - these are hard for us to manage, and frequently unproductive. We have a dedicated Q&A tent - located near the lounge - where you can do this instead, and direct people to join you there after your talk.
{% endif %}

* All this information and more is available on our speakers website page: https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Speaking

Looking forward to seeing you in the field,
The EMF Speaker Ops Team
