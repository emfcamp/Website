""" Monitors static_url_for calls and inserts HTTP Link rel=preload headers
    for them.

    If the "nopush" option is not set, the upstream NGINX server will use
    HTTP/2 server push to send these assets along with the page, which is
    a significant performance improvement on first page load. However, it's
    wasteful to push the same assets on subsequent page loads.

    Otherwise, the browser still knows about the asset earlier and can start
    loading them before it's parsed the HTML.
