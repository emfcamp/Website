    Schedule App

    This app displays what talks are happening from the CfP system. A deceptively complex task.
    The schedule for an event can be in one of four modes:

        * There's no schedule yet, why not look at previous years'?
        * There are talks accepted, but they aren't scheduled yet - show them in a list
          and maybe let the user favourite them to assist our scheduling algorithm.
        * There's actually a schedule and you should probably work out which talks you're going to.
        * The event has finished, and we're displaying an archived schedule.

    ## Configuration Flags

    The schedule app uses two configuration flags to determine how to render the schedule
    for the current event (these don't affect historic events).

        * `LINE_UP = True` indicates that the approved talks should be displayed as a list
        * `SCHEDULE = True` indicates that the full schedule browser should be displayed

    If neither of these flags are enabled, links will be displayed to schedules for previous
    events.
