""" Payment handler for Stripe credit card payments.

    This takes credit card payments using Stripe's
    [Payment Intents](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents) API.

    In theory we could use this handler to take payments for other methods which
    Stripe supports, such as iDEAL. However, Payment Intents doesn't support these
    (as of Nov 2019), so it would involve using a different flow which would
    complicate this code.
