description: Operate the sound and lighting systems
full_description_md: |
  The sound & lighting operators on our stages make sure speakers look and sound great, both in person and when recordings are watched online. You'll be working with the rest of the stage team to adjust audio levels, switch lighting states at the begning and end of talks.

  **You'll need to attend one of our training sessions before your shift, these will be run daily, and are a great opportunity to learn more about live event production.**
