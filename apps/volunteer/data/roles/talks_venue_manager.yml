name: "Talks: Venue Manager"
description: Coordinate between the stage and content teams
full_description_md: |
  Venue managers are responsible for the main stages while talks are running. They coordinate between the stage and content teams to make sure any special requirements from speakers are accommodated, either resolve or escalate any technical issues, and make sure the stages are operating safely.

  You'll need to be able to communicate clearly with multiple teams, and calmly deal with problems in a fast paced environment.
