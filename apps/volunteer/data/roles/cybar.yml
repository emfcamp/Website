  The Extraction Division of Polybius Biotech has been taken over by rebels. They will be hosting CYBAR (the second bar onsite) in NullSector. 
  
  During the day, there will be a number of installations at NullSector, and during the evening NullSector will be hosting many of the finest DJs.

  WE NEED YOU! Come join us to make the magic happen. This year we're upping our offering, and serving 3 different drafts along with wine and spirits!
  
  There are loads of benefits to volunteering at an EMF bar (especially a CYBAR):
  
  1. Serving your fellow festival-goers and working with a team of volunteers  in the fast paced environment behind the bar is a great way to meet new people and socialise, it doesn't really feel like work at all.
  2. It's a great way to learn how to work on a bar and get experience if you ever fancy a career change! We'll teach you everything you need to know on the job, it's really easy once you get started.
  3. Usually the bar shifts are pretty short so they're easy to fit in with other things you might want to do, you can even pop back later and help out if there's a big queue, and help get your friends served quicker.
  4. CYBAR shifts come with the finest extraction base uniform (optional), there was something about a hex something too for volunteers (it says TOP SEKRET here). 
  
  Working behind the bar is loads of fun, it's not hard work, and without lovely people like you we'd have no bar, so volunteer for a shift or two, or even three!
