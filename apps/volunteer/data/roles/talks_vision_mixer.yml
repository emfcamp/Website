full_description_md: |
  You'll operate the video mixer to ensure content is visible on the venue screens and is being sent to the streaming/recording system along with video from the cameras.

  You'll also work with the camera operator to adjust shots so that people look their best, and raise any technical issues to the venue manager so they can be fixed.

  **You'll need to attend one of our training sessions before your shift, these will be run daily, and are a great opportunity to learn more about live event production.**
