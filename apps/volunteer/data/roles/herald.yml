description: Introduce talks and manage speakers at stage.
full_description_md: |
  Introducing talks, and making any announcements that are needed between talks.
  
  You'll be helping speakers get ready, introducing them on stage and checking to make sure any announcements that need to happen are made between talks. If you have any talks you'd particularly like to see you can volunteer for a shift on the appropriate stage.\n\nIf you've never walked on stage before then don't be put off; we'll be running some training to walk through the role and make sure everyone is comfortable. In fact many of us would identify as introverts.
