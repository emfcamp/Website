Run the audio for a stage. Make sure mics are working and that presentations work.

# What's involved

* Testing sound levels for the next speaker
* Managing sound levels during talks
* Recalling lighting presets
* Helping speakers set up any presentations/audio they require

No experience is required, although it might be helpful to have used an audio mixer
before.
