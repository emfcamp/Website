Introducing talks, and making any announcements that are needed between talks.

You'll be introducing speakers, and checking the wiki to make sure any announcements that need to happen are made between talks. If you have any talks you'd particularly like to see you can volunteer for a shift on the appropriate stage.

If you've never walked on stage before, then don't be put off. In fact many of us would identify as introverts. Personal growth is all about pushing yourself to do things that might be at the edge of your comfort zone so do challenge yourself and we'll help make sure you are comfortable in the team and role.
