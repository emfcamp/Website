Be a point of contact for attendees. Either helping with finding things or just getting an idea for what's on.

The information desk is generally the first place people come to with questions, you’ll have a set of answers to commonly asked questions, and phone numbers for people who can help you get answers to the ones we haven’t thought of.

You’ll also be responsible for swapping t-shirt tokens for actual t-shirts, and managing lost property.
