Running Indie Games on the big screen in Stage A, and optionally Board Games.

# What you'll be doing

The Games Master will set up a hangout place for people to watch and play games,
both computer and boardgames. We'll provide a laptop, controllers, and games to
run on the big screen, and there are people bringing board games.

## Setup

* Ambient music played over the PA
* Laptop projecting onto the big presentation screen
* Conference style chair seating near the front and centre of the stage moved
  away to form an open space for people to come and sit in an organic arrangement
* Optionally, move any available tables into the area for board games

## Running

* Attempting to fix any game/tech issues
* Moving on people who've been hogging the screen if a queue is forming
* If you happen to know about board games, maybe recommending ones that people
  would enjoy.

## Close

* Restore seating
* Pack away and secure laptop/controllers etc
* Power down AV equipment
