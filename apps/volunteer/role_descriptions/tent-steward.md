Check the various tents (e.g. Arcade, Lounge, Spillout) are clean and everything's OK.

You’ll be rotating between the Arcade, Lounge, and Spillout area. In each you’ll make sure things are clean, and help people out with any issues they have there. In the arcade you may also need to help out with the machines a bit - mostly topping up credits, and restarting crashed games.
