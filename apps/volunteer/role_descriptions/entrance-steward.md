Greet people, check their tickets and help them get on site.

On the first day this role involves checking tickets and welcoming people to the site, after that it's mostly just checking that people have wristbands on when they walk in.

The entrance needs stewards on it 24/7, so if you’re the sort of person who’s likely to be up all night talking anyway, why not volunteer for a shift on the entrance gate and do your talking there?
