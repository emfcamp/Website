## Alcohol
Alcohol, also known by its chemical name ethanol, is a psychoactive substance that is the active ingredient in drinks such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits. Thanks, [​Wikipedia​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug))!

The consumption of alcohol has a clear impact on public health as it is a causal factor in more than 60 medical conditions, including: mouth, throat, stomach, liver and breast cancers; high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver; and depression and must therefore be consumed responsibly. Alcohol consumption is influenced by availability, so the availability of alcohol is restricted by a licensing system.

In the UK, the alcoholic content of a drink is generally shown as "alcohol by volume", abbreviated as ABV. This is defined as the number of millilitres (mL) of pure ethanol present in 100 mL of drink at 20°C. (Thanks again, [​Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume)​! The page on this is worth a read; it’s not a simple subject.) For our purposes, the amount of alcohol in a drink is the amount of drink (eg. 25ml) multiplied by the ABV (eg. 40%, or 0.4).

The law defines an "alcoholic drink" as any drink with more than **​0.5% ABV**​; sales of these drinks are restricted and can only be made in accordance with a licence. (Aside: "alcohol-free" drinks contain less than 0.05% ABV; this figure isn’t relevant to licensing.)

A ​**unit**​ of alcohol in the UK is 10 millilitres. The official advice is that a typical healthy adult can metabolise (break down) **​one unit of alcohol per hour​**, and that to keep health risks from alcohol low it is safest not to regularly drink more than ​**14 units per week​**.
  
Examples of alcohol content of common drinks:

- A pint of 4% ABV beer: 2.3 units
- A 25ml measure of 40% ABV spirit: 1 unit
- A 175ml glass of 12% ABV wine: 2.1 units
