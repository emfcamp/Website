## Safety
### Health and safety

- You should wear suitable footwear behind the bar: the floor may be wet, and there is a possibility that things might be dropped on it.
- Although we’re not using much glass, there will be some glass bottles and it is possible that these might become broken. Don’t attempt to clear up broken glass by hand: use the dustpan and brush and make sure the broken glass goes in the bottle bin.
- Report accidents or near-misses, bad practices and potential hazards to the bar organisers.
- You are responsible for your own safety and that of everyone else. If you are unsure about something, seek advice.

### Food safety
The area behind the bar is a food preparation area. While you are in this area there are some things you must do and some things you must not do.

#### Things you must do

- Wash your hands when entering the bar area.
- Wash your hands after wiping down the bar.
- Cuts and grazes, etc. must be covered using waterproof plasters.

#### Things you must not do

- You must not smoke or take snuff.
- **You must not consume food while behind the bar.**​ (This is the rule that we have to remind people of most often.)
- You must not put your fingers inside the glass or on the rim of the glass while pouring into it and handing it to the customer.
- You must not use a glass to scoop up ice from the ice bucket. Always use the scoop or tongs provided.
