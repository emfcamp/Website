## Age restrictions
Although there are some exceptions to the following, they don’t apply at EMF so we won’t be covering them.

It is illegal:

- to sell alcohol to anyone under the age of 18
- to sell tobacco to anyone under the age of 18 (we have to mention this, even though we don’t sell tobacco)
- for an adult to buy or attempt to buy alcohol on behalf of someone under 18
- for someone under 18 to buy alcohol, attempt to buy alcohol or to be sold alcohol
- for someone under 18 to drink alcohol in licensed premises

Since it is very difficult to tell if someone is over 18 (are they 17 and 51 weeks?) we have an **Age Verification Policy​** that everyone working on the bar must follow. It is informally referred to as “Challenge 25”. 

### Age verification policy
It is our policy that every person attempting to buy alcohol who appears to be under the age of 25 and who has not already provided proof of age to the person serving them will be required to prove that they are aged 18 or over.

The following documents will be accepted as proof:

- Passport
- Full, or provisional, UK or EU photocard driving license
- Proof of age card bearing the PASS hologram
- National identity card issued by an EU member state, such as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
- Biometric immigration document

In the event that proof of age is requested and is not provided, the sale of alcohol will not go ahead and the person serving the alcohol will make an entry in the refusals log. The decision to refuse service is solely that of the person serving and this decision will not be overturned by any other member of staff.

### Penalties
Licensing authorities take sales to people who are underage very seriously. ​**Police officers** may send people who are obviously underage into licensed premises to attempt to purchase alcohol; if they are successful in doing so the police can issue an on-the-spot fine of ​£90​. In theory we could be fined up to £20,000 if this happens multiple times. This will affect our ability to get a licence for EMF in the future, so please be careful!
