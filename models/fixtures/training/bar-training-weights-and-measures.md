## Weights and measures
Beer is served in multiples of half a pint. The pint and half pint glasses we use are CE marked and legal to serve into directly.

Wine is served in measures of 125ml, 175ml and 250ml. The glasses aren’t marked for this, so we have CE marked 125ml and 175ml thimble measures behind the bar: fill the measure to the brim and tip it into the glass.

We have chosen to serve spirits in multiples of 25ml. We have CE marked thimble measures and optics. (It isn’t legal to mix 25ml and 35ml measures on the same site.)
