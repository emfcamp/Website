## Drunkenness
It’s against the law to serve alcohol to anyone who is drunk; doing so can lead to fines of up to **​£1,000**​. Unfortunately, the law doesn’t define drunkenness and there is no consistent system of enforcement.

For EMF, we will treat someone as drunk if we believe drinking has made them ​**a danger to themselves or others​**, for example if they are staggering or showing an inability to walk. If you believe someone is drunk, then you must not serve them or anybody else who you believe is trying to obtain alcohol for them.
