## Licensing in England and Wales
In England and Wales there are four ​licensing objectives:​

1. The prevention of crime and disorder
2. Public safety
3. The prevention of public nuisance
4. The protection of children from harm

(Scotland has five, and six are proposed for Northern Ireland, but that doesn’t matter right now...)

Licensing regulates these four activities:

1. the retail sale of alcohol
2. the supply of alcohol in clubs
3. the provision of late night refreshment
4. the provision of regulated entertainment

We’re only covering the first of these in this training course.

Licensing is split into two parts: the premises where alcohol is sold, and the people who authorise the sales.

The **​Premises Licence**​ describes the physical location where licensable activities will take place, and contains the **​operating schedule**​ which lists all of the **licensable activities​** that may take place and the ​times​ at which these are allowed. The operating schedule also contains conditions which must be complied with that are agreed between the licensing authority and the premises licence holder and have the force of law.

A **​Personal Licence**​ enables its holder to authorise the sale of alcohol on licensed premises; every sale of alcohol must be authorised by a personal licence holder. This doesn’t have to be done in person: generally, at each premises there will be a list of people to whom a personal licence holder has delegated this authority. By completing this training, you are joining this list of people at EMF.

If a premises licence includes the sale of alcohol as one of the licensable activities, it must specify a single personal licence holder as the ​**Designated Premises Supervisor**​. This is the person who is in ​**day-to-day control**​ of the premises: the person who sets the rules and policies and ensures they are followed. They don’t have to be present all of the time: they are allowed to go on holiday, for example! They are the first point of contact for the licensing authorities at the premises.
